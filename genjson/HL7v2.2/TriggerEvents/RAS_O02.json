{"id":"RAS_O02","msgStructId":"RAS_O02","eventDesc":"Pharmacy/treatment administration message","description":"The RAS message may be created by the administering application (e.g., nursing application) for each instance of administration for an existing order.  If the administering application wants to report several administrations of medication for a given order with a single RAS message, each instance is reported by a separate (repeating) RXA segment.  In addition, the administration records for a group of orders may be sent in a single message by creating repeating groups of segments at the ORC level.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient Allergy Information","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Commom Order","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER DETAIL","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXO","name":"RXO","longName":"Pharmacy Prescription Order","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER DETAIL SUPPLEMENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy Route","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"COMPONENTS","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXC","name":"RXC","longName":"Pharmacy Component Order","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]},{"id":null,"name":"ENCODING","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXE","name":"RXE","longName":"Pharmacy Encoded Order","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy Route","sequence":"14","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXC","name":"RXC","longName":"Pharmacy Component Order","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"RXA","name":"RXA","longName":"Pharmacy Aadministration","sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy Route","sequence":"17","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation Result","sequence":"18","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}
