There are multiple approaches by which systems become aware of documents:\r\n\r\nScenario A: A document is dictated and chart tracking system is notified that it has been dictated and is awaiting transcription. \r\n\r\nScenario B: Dictation is transcribed and chart tracking system is notified that the document exists and requires authentication. \r\n\r\nScenario C: A provider orders a series of three X-rays.  The radiologist dictates a single document which covers all three orders.  Multiple placer numbers are used to identify each of these orders.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_09"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"COMMON_ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common Order","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"TIMING","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"TQ1","name":"TQ1","longName":"Timing/quantity","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"TQ2","name":"TQ2","longName":"Timing/quantity Relationship","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"OBR","name":"OBR","longName":"Observation Request","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"TXA","name":"TXA","longName":"Transcription Document Header","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"CON","name":"CON","longName":"Consent Segment","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
