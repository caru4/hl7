{"id":"CCR_I18","msgStructId":"CCR_I18","eventDesc":"Cancel Collaborative Care Referral","description":"This event triggers a message to be sent from one healthcare provider to another canceling an existing Collaborative Care Referral.  A previous Collaborative Care Referral may have been made in error, or perhaps the cancellation has come from the patient. Whilst the acknowledgment is a simple ACK message, the expectation is that the referred to provider(s) will send back a CCU â€“ Asynchronous Collaborative Care Update at a later time to indicate cancellation of the Collaborative Care Referral.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_11"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message
