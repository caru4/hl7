It may be sent as an unsolicited message to report on either a single order or multiple pharmacy/treatment orders for a patient.\r\n\r\nThe RDE/RRE message pair can also be used to communicate a refill authorization request; however, a specific trigger event has been assigned. See section 4A.3.13 \"RDE - Pharmacy/Treatment Refill Authorization Request Message (Event O25).\" As a site-specific variant, the original order segments (RXO, RXRs, associated RXCs, and any NTEs) may be sent optionally (for comparison).\r\n\r\nNote: \r\nThe RXCs which follow the RXO may not be fully encoded, but those that follow the RXE must be fully encoded.\r\nThe NTE segment(s) following the PD1 segment are intended to communicate notes and comments relative to the patient.\r\nThe NTE segment(s) following the RXO segment are intended to communicate notes and comments relative to the pharmacy/treatment order.\r\nThe NTE segment(s) following the RXE segment are intended to communicate notes and comments relative to the encoded order.\r\nThe NTE segment(s) following the RXC segment are intended to communicate notes and comments relative to the component(s).\r\nThe NTE segment following the OBX segment is intended to communicate notes and comments relative to the results.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit -
