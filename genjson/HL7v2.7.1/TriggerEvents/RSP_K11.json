Its default trigger event is K11.  A standard or site-defined response may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Query Profile.  If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined response, that value SHALL begin with Z. \r\n\r\nNote on RSP:  The Query Profile for each QBP/RSP pair shall specify an explicit segment pattern grammar in place of the ellipses shown above in the RSP_K11 grammar.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_05"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","name":"MSA","longName":"Message Acknowledgment","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","name":"ERR","longName":"Error","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QAK","name":"QAK","longName":"Query Acknowledgment","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QPD","name":"QPD","longName":"Query Parameter Definition","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"SEGMENT_PATTERN","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"Hxx","name":"Hxx","longName":"Any Hl7 Segment","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"DSC","name":"DSC","longName":"Continuation Pointer","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
