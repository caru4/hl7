Its default trigger event is Q13.  A standard or site-defined query may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Query Profile.  If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined query, that value SHALL begin with Z.\r\n\r\nUnless otherwise specified in the query's Query Profile, the default value for the RDF segment shall be understood to contain all available fields from the Virtual Table. The Client may override the default RDF by specifying explicitly the columns to be returned.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_05"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QPD","name":"QPD","longName":"Query Parameter Definition","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"QBP","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"Hxx","name":"Hxx","longName":"Any Hl7 Segment","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"RDF","name":"RDF","longName":"Table Row Definition","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RCP","name":"RCP","longName":"Response Control Parameter","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DSC","name":"DSC","longName":"Continuation Pointer","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
