{"id":"AIL","segmentId":"AIL","longName":"Appointment Information - Location Resource","description":"The AIL segment contains information about location resources (meeting rooms, operating rooms, examination rooms, or other locations) that can be scheduled.  Resources included in a transaction using this segment are assumed to be controlled by a schedule on a schedule filler application.  Resources not controlled by a schedule are not identified on a schedule request using this segment.  Location resources are identified with this specific segment because of the specific encoding of locations used by the HL7 specification.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_10"],"fields":[{"id":"AIL.1","type":"Field","position":"AIL.1","length":4,"dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Set Id - Ail","description":null},{"id":"AIL.2","type":"Field","position":"AIL.2","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"0206","tableName":"Segment action code","name":"Segment Action Code","description":null},{"id":"AIL.3","type":"Field","position":"AIL.3","length":0,"dataType":"PL","dataTypeName":"Person Location","usage":"C","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Location Resource Id","description":null},{"id":"AIL.4","type":"Field","position":"AIL.4","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"0305","tableName":"Person Location Type","name":"Location Type - Ail","description":null},{"id":"AIL.5","type":"Field","position":"AIL.5","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Location Group","description":null},{"id":"AIL.6","type":"Field","position":"AIL.6","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Start Date/Time","description":null},{"id":"AIL.7","type":"Field","position":"AIL.7","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Start Date/Time Offset","description":null},{"id":"AIL.8","type":"Field","position":"AIL.8","length":0,"dataType":"CNE","dataTypeName":"Coded With No Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Start Date/Time Offset Units","description":null},{"id":"AIL.9","type":"Field","position":"AIL.9","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Duration","description":null},{"id":"AIL.10","type":"Field","position":"AIL.10","length":0,"dataType":"CNE","dataTypeName":"Coded With No Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Duration Units","description":null},{"id":"AIL.11","type":"Field","position":"AIL.11","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"0279","tableName":"Allow Substitution Codes","name":"Allow Substitution Code","description":null},{"id":"AIL.12","type":"Field","position":"AIL.12","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"0278","tableName":"Filler status codes","name":"Filler Status Code","description":null}]}
