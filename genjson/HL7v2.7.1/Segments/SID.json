{"id":"SID","segmentId":"SID","longName":"Substance Identifier","description":"The Substance Identifier segment contains data necessary to identify the substance (e.g., reagents) used in the production of analytical test results. The combination of these fields must uniquely identify the substance, i.e., depending on the manufacturer all or some fields are required (this is the reason the optionality is 'C' (conditional)). If the analysis requires multiple substances, this segment is repeated for each substance. The segment(s) should be attached to the TCD segment.\r\n\r\nAnother purpose of this segment is to transfer the control manufacturer, lot, etc., information for control specimens. In this case the SID segment should be attached to the SAC segment describing the container with the control specimen.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_13"],"fields":[{"id":"SID.1","type":"Field","position":"SID.1","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Application/Method Identifier","description":null},{"id":"SID.2","type":"Field","position":"SID.2","length":0,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Substance Lot Number","description":null},{"id":"SID.3","type":"Field","position":"SID.3","length":0,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Substance Container Identifier","description":null},{"id":"SID.4","type":"Field","position":"SID.4","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"0385","tableName":"Manufacturer Identifier","name":"Substance Manufacturer Identifier","description":null}]}
