Therefore, a separate discontinue block transaction is not necessary.  If this transaction is received prior to the inception of a blocked period, then the entire block period is simply canceled according to the data provided in the transaction.  If the transaction is received after the blocked period has begun, but prior to the end of the blocked period, then the blocked period is discontinued according to the data provided in the transactions.
