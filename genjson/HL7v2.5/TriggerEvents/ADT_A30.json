{"id":"ADT_A30","msgStructId":"ADT_A30","eventDesc":"Merge Person Information","description":"Event A30 has been retained for backward compatibility only.  An A30 event was used to merge person information on an MPI.  From V 2.3.1 onwards, the A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list) events should be used to merge patient information for a current episode.  The “incorrect MRN” identified on the MRG segment (MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List) is to be merged with the “correct MRN” identified on the PID segment (PID-3 - Patient Identifier List).  The “incorrect MRN” then no longer exists.  All PID data associated with the “correct MRN” are treated as updated information. \r\n\r\nThe MRNs involved may or may not have active or inactive cases associated with them.  Any episode of care that was previously associated with the “incorrect MRN” is now associated with the “correct MRN.”  A list of these cases is not provided. \r\n\r\nThe fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event.  When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition. \r\n\r\nAn A30 (merge person information) is intended for merging person records without merging patient identifiers.
