During this process, episoderelated data is collected in preparation for a patientâ€™s visit or stay in a healthcare facility.  For example, a pre-admit may be performed prior to inpatient or outpatient surgery so that lab tests can be performed prior to the surgery.  This event can also be used to pre-register a non-admitted patient.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next of Kin / Associated Parties","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","name":"DB1","longName":"Disability","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/Result","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient Allergy Information","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","name":"DRG","longName":"Diagnosis Related Group","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PROCEDURE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","name":"PR1","longName":"Procedures","sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance","sequence":"19","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance Additional Information","sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance Additional Information, Certification","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","name":"ACC","longName":"Accident","sequence":"23","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","name":"UB1","longName":"UB82 Data","sequence":"24","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","name":"UB2","longName":"UB92 Data","sequence":"25","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
