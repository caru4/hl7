{"id":"TQ1","segmentId":"TQ1","longName":"Timing/Quantity","description":"The TQ1 segment is used to specify the complex timing of events and actions such as those that occur in order management and scheduling systems. This segment determines the quantity, frequency, priority, and timing of a service. By allowing the segment to repeat, it is possible to have service requests that vary the quantity, frequency and priority of a service request over time.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_04"],"fields":[{"id":"TQ1.1","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.1","length":4,"dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence ID","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Set ID - TQ1","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.2","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.2","length":20,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Quantity","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.3","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.3","length":540,"dataType":"RPT","dataTypeName":"Repeat Pattern","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Repeat Pattern","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.4","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.4","length":20,"dataType":"TM","dataTypeName":"Time","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Explicit Time","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.5","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.5","length":20,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Relative Time and Units","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.6","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.6","length":20,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Service Duration","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.7","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.7","length":26,"dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Start date/time","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.8","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.8","length":26,"dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"End date/time","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.9","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.9","length":250,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded with Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":"0485","tableName":"Extended Priority Codes","name":"Priority","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.10","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.10","length":250,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Condition text","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.11","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.11","length":250,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Text instruction","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.12","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.12","length":10,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"0427","tableName":"Risk Management Incident Code","name":"Conjunction","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.13","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.13","length":20,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Occurrence duration","description":null},{"id":"TQ1.14","type":"Field","position":"TQ1.14","length":10,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Total occurrences","description":null}]}
