{"id":"UB2","segmentId":"UB2","longName":"UB92 Data","description":"The UB2 segment contains data necessary to complete UB92 bills specific to the United States; other realms may choose to implement using regional code sets. Only UB82 and UB92 fields that do not exist in other HL7 defined segments appear in this segment.  Just as with the UB82 billing, Patient Name and Date of Birth are required; they are included in the PID segment and therefore do not appear here. When the field locators are different on the UB92, as compared to the UB82, the element is listed with its new location in parentheses ( ). The UB codes listed as examples are not an exhaustive or current list; refer to a UB specification for additional information.\r\n\r\nThe Uniform Billing segments are specific to the US and may not be implemented in non-US systems.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_06"],"fields":[{"id":"UB2.1","type":"Field","position":"UB2.1","length":4,"dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence ID","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Set ID - UB2","description":null},{"id":"UB2.2","type":"Field","position":"UB2.2","length":3,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Co-Insurance Days (9)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.3","type":"Field","position":"UB2.3","length":2,"dataType":"IS","dataTypeName":"Coded value for user-defined tables","usage":"O","rpt":"7","tableId":"0043","tableName":"Condition Code","name":"Condition Code (24-30)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.4","type":"Field","position":"UB2.4","length":3,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Covered Days (7)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.5","type":"Field","position":"UB2.5","length":4,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Non-Covered Days (8)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.6","type":"Field","position":"UB2.6","length":41,"dataType":"UVC","dataTypeName":"UB Value Code and Amount","usage":"O","rpt":"12","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Value Amount and Code","description":null},{"id":"UB2.7","type":"Field","position":"UB2.7","length":259,"dataType":"OCD","dataTypeName":"Occurrence Code and Date","usage":"O","rpt":"8","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Occurrence Code and Date (32-35)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.8","type":"Field","position":"UB2.8","length":268,"dataType":"OSP","dataTypeName":"Occurrence Span Code and Date","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Occurrence Span Code/Dates (36)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.9","type":"Field","position":"UB2.9","length":29,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 2 (State)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.10","type":"Field","position":"UB2.10","length":12,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 11 (State)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.11","type":"Field","position":"UB2.11","length":5,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 31 (National)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.12","type":"Field","position":"UB2.12","length":23,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Document Control Number","description":null},{"id":"UB2.13","type":"Field","position":"UB2.13","length":4,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"23","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 49 (National)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.14","type":"Field","position":"UB2.14","length":14,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"5","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 56 (State)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.15","type":"Field","position":"UB2.15","length":27,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 57 (National)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.16","type":"Field","position":"UB2.16","length":2,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 78 (State)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.17","type":"Field","position":"UB2.17","length":3,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Special Visit Count","description":null}]}
