{"id":"IIM","segmentId":"IIM","longName":"Inventory Item Master","description":"The Inventory Item Master segment (IIM) contains information about the stock of product that can be used to fulfill an ordered test/service. All of the fields in this segment describe the test/service and other basic attributes pertaining to Service Item defined within an Other Observation/Service Item master file. This segment is related to centrally stocked or supply management concerns.\r\n\r\nNote:  We recognize that the M15 Inventory Item Master File trigger event and the IIM inventory item master segment is a limited implementation.  There is a comprehensive Materials Management message in development for inclusion in the next release.  For further information contact the Scheduling and Logistics TC.  This will be coordinated with the Control/Query TC and the Orders and Observations TC.
