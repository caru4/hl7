{"id":"ADT_A06","msgStructId":"ADT_A06","eventDesc":"Change an outpatient to an inpatient","description":"An A06 event is sent when a patient who was present for a non-admitted visit is being admitted after an evaluation of the seriousness of the patient's condition. This event changes a patient's status from non-admitted to admitted. The new patient location should appear in PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location, while the old patient location (if different) should appear in PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location. The new patient class should appear in PV1-2 - Patient Class.\r\n\r\nIt will be left to implementation negotiation to determine whether disparate systems merely change the patient class, or close and open a new account. The current active account number should appear in field PID-18 - Patient Account Number; the prior account number can be included optionally in MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number. This arrangement is not intended to be a type of merge. The MRG segment isused here only for MRG-3 - Prior Patient Account Number. PV1-19 - Visit Number may also be changed during this event.\r\n\r\nThe fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event. When other important fields change, it is recommended that the A08 (update patient information) event be used in addition.\r\n\r\nThe ROL - Role Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere. Person level providers with an ongoing relationship are reported in the ROL segment following the PID/PD1 segments. Visit level providers (corresponding to the PV1 data) are reported in the ROL segment following the PV1/PV2 segments. Providers related to a specific procedure are reported in the ROL segment following the PR1 segment. Providers related to a specific insurance are reported in the ROL segment following the IN1/IN2/IN3 segments. To communicate the begin- and end-date of the provider, use the ROL-5 - Role Begin Date/Time and the ROL-6 - Role End Date/Time in the ROL segment, with the applicable ROL-3 - Role Code. Refer to Chapter 15 for the definition of the ROL segment.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restriction","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge Patient Information","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next Of Kin / Associated Parties","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restriction","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","name":"DB1","longName":"Disability","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient Allergy Information","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","name":"DRG","longName":"Diagnosis Related Group","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PROCEDURE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","name":"PR1","longName":"Procedures","sequence":"20","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance","sequence":"23","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance Additional Information","sequence":"24","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance Additional Information, Certification","sequence":"25","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"26","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","name":"ACC","longName":"Accident","sequence":"27","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","name":"UB1","longName":"Ub82","sequence":"28","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","name":"UB2","longName":"Uniform Billing Data","sequence":"29","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
