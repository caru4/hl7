{"id":"EHC_E02","msgStructId":"EHC_E02","eventDesc":"Cancel HealthCare Services Invoice","description":"This message is used to cancel one HealthCare Services Invoices or one Product/Service Group in an Invoice or one Product/Service Line Item in an Invoice that have previously been submitted to a TPA/Payer for processing and payment.  Invoice Control codes are used to indicate the specific action being requested of the Payer (CN for Cancel Invoice, CG for Cancel Product/Service Group and CI for Cancel Product/Service Line Item). An Invoice that is cancelled must be marked as cancel only and not purged from the Payer Application's database. \r\n\r\nThe Payer may/may not be able to cancel the Invoice/Product/Service Line Item, and will indicate processing results in the response message. In some situations, the Payer has already paid the Product/Service Line Item, and therefore will hold a debit amount for the Payee until subsequent billing from the Payee utilizes the debit amount.\r\n\r\nThis message cannot be used to cancel or remove ancillary information for an Invoice and/or Product/Service Line Item such as Authorization or Contact information or any referenced health documents.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_16"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"INVOICE INFORMATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IVC","name":"IVC","longName":"Invoice Segment","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PYE","name":"PYE","longName":"Payee Information","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"CTD","name":"CTD","longName":"Contact Data","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PRODUCT SERVICE SECTION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSS","name":"PSS","longName":"Product/service Section","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PSG","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSG","name":"PSG","longName":"Product/service Group","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PSL","name":"PSL","longName":"Product/service Line Item","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}]}
