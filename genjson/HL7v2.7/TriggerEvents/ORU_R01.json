{"id":"ORU_R01","msgStructId":"ORU_R01","eventDesc":"Unsolicited transmission of an observation message","description":"The ORU message is for transmitting laboratory results to other systems. The OUL message is designed to accommodate the laboratory processes of laboratory automation systems.\r\n\r\nWith the segment (OBX) defined in this chapter, and the OBR defined in Chapter 4, one can construct almost any clinical report as a multi-level hierarchy, with the PID segment defined in Chapter 3 at the upper level, an order record (OBR) at the next level with one or more observation records (OBX), followed by the specimen information (SPM) and one or more observations (OBX) directly associated with the specimen.\r\n\r\nOne result segment (OBX) is transmitted for each component of a diagnostic report, such as an EKG or obstetrical ultrasound or electrolyte battery.\r\n\r\nThe CTD segment in this trigger is used to transmit temporary patient contact details specific to this order.\r\n\r\nNote: The ORC is permitted but not required in this message. Any information that could be included in either the ORC or the OBR must be included in the OBR on reporting. Notice also that the ORU (and the QRY) messages accommodate reports about many patients.\r\n\r\nMany report headers (OBR) may be sent beneath each patient segment, with many separate observation segments (OBX) related to the order / observation request beneath each OBR. OBX segments that are related to specimens immediately follow the SPM segments. Note segments (NTE) may be inserted at different locations in the message. The note segment applies to the entity that immediately precedes it, i.e., the patient if it follows the PID segment, the observation request if it follows the OBR segment, and the individual result if it follows the OBX segment.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_07"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_RESULT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next Of Kin / Associated Parties","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit -
