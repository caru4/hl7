{"id":"EHC_E15","msgStructId":"EHC_E15","eventDesc":"Payment/Remittance Advice","description":"This message is used to send a payment/ remittance advice to a Payee for the payment of HealthCare Services Invoices and/or other adjustments.   The Payment/Remittance Advice can be sent to the originating Provider Application (Network Application ID) or alternately to the Payee's Network Application ID, depending on how the Payee has been configured by the Payer. If a Payment/Remittance Advice is paid by check, it typically has a 1 to 1 correspondence with a check number. However, there are occasions when one check number covers multiple Payment/Remittance Advices. This message does not enforce a 1 to 1 relationship between check number and Payment/Remittance Advice. That is, the same check number (Check Number on PMT) can be used on multiple Payment/Remittance Advices.\r\n\r\nA Payment/Remittance Advice may not be generated if a Payee is a Person and not an organization (Payee Type on PYE = \"PERS\" or \"PPER\").\r\n\r\nOnce an EHC^E15 message is prepared (which may be on a regular basis such as monthly or bi-weekly), it is either sent to the Provider Application (if the Provider Application is able to receive unsolicited results) or stored on a queue for the Provider Application. If left on a queue for the Provider Application, then the QBP^E99 message must be used by the Provider Application to poll the Payer Application for the EHC^E15.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_16"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PAYMENT REMITTANCE HEADER INFO","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PMT","name":"PMT","longName":"Payment Information","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PYE","name":"PYE","longName":"Payee Information","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"PAYMENT REMITTANCE DETAIL INFO","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IPR","name":"IPR","longName":"Invoice Processing Results","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IVC","name":"IVC","longName":"Invoice Segment","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PRODUCT SERVICE SECTION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSS","name":"PSS","longName":"Product/service Section","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PRODUCT SERVICE GROUP","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSG","name":"PSG","longName":"Product/service Group","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PSL ITEM INFO","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSL","name":"PSL","longName":"Product/service Line Item","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ADJ","name":"ADJ","longName":"Adjustment","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}]},{"id":null,"name":"ADJUSTMENT PAYEE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ADJ","name":"ADJ","longName":"Adjustment","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
