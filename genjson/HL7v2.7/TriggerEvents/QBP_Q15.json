{"id":"QBP_Q15","msgStructId":"QBP_Q15","eventDesc":"Query by parameter requesting an RDY display response","description":"The QBP_Q15 structure supports a Display Response and contains the MSH, QPD, RCP, and DSC segments.  Its default trigger event is Q15.  A standard or site-defined query may use this trigger event or may specify a unique trigger event value in its Query Profile.  If a unique trigger event value is chosen for a site-defined query, that value SHALL begin with Z.\r\n\r\nNote on QBP: Query By Example variant:  The query by example is an extension of Query by Parameter (QBP) in which search parameters are passed by sending them in the segment which naturally carries them. A Query Profile which uses this variant SHALL replace the ellipses in the input QBP_Q11 grammar above, with the specific segments that it accepts.
