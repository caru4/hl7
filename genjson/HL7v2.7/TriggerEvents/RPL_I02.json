Generally, this request is used by the responder when insufficient data is on hand for a positive match.  In this case, the requester may ask for a list of possible candidates from which to make a selection.  This event code is also used by the responder to signify that the return information contains a list of information rather than information specific to a single patient.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_11"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","name":"MSA","longName":"Message Acknowledgment","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PROVIDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PRD","name":"PRD","longName":"Provider Data","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"CTD","name":"CTD","longName":"Contact Data","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DSP","name":"DSP","longName":"Display Data","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DSC","name":"DSC","longName":"Continuation Pointer","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
