An A01 event is sent as a result of a patient undergoing the admission process which assigns the patient to a bed. It signals the beginning of a patient's stay in a healthcare facility. Normally, this information is entered in the primary Patient Administration system and broadcast to the nursing units and ancillary systems. It includes short stay and \"Adam Everyman\" (e.g., patient name is unknown) admissions. For example, an A01 event can be used to notify: the pharmacy system that a patient has been admitted and may be legitimately prescribed drugs; thenursing system that the patient has been admitted and needs a care plan prepared; the finance system of the start of the billing period; the dietary system that a new patient has been installed and requires dietary services; the laboratory, pathology, and radiology systems that a patient has been admitted and is entitled to receive services; the clinical repository that an admission has taken place for the EMR (electronic medical record).\r\n\r\nWhen an account's start and end dates span a period greater than any particular visit, the P01 (add patient account) event should be used to transmit the opening of an account. The A01 event can notify systems of the creation of an account as well as notify them of a patient's arrival in the healthcare facility. In order to create a new account without notifying of patient's arrival, use the P01 event.\r\n\r\nThe ROL - Role Segment is used in this message to communicate providers not specified elsewhere.

There are three situations that qualify as non-census location changes: (a) patient tracking, (b) the patient is in transit between locations for some time, (c) a notification of temporary location change.\r\n\r\nPatient tracking: This can be used when the nursing application sends a \"transfer\" before the Patient Administration (or official census) system issues an A02 (transfer a patient) event. If the patient has left for a non-temporary location and is not in transit, then the PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location must contain the new patient location, while PV1-6 - Prior Patient Location must contain the old patient location.\r\n\r\nIn transit: The patient's location during the time between an A09 and an A10 (patient arriving - tracking) is defined as \"in transit.\" The A09 event is sent when a patient departs from one area of the healthcare facility for the purpose of arriving at another area, but without leaving the healthcare institution. This event is used when there is a time span during which the patient is neither at his/her old location nor at his/her new location. This process can take some time if a patient is being sent to another area in a multi-campus or multi-facility environment. The combination of an A09 and an A10 would serve the same purpose as an A02 (transfer a patient) event, except that it accounts for a gap in time required for transport between facilities. If the patient will be in transit during the time between the A09 (patient departing - tracking) event and the A10 (patient arriving - tracking) event, then PV1-42 - Pending Location is used for the new location, and PV1-11 - Temporary Location and PV1-43 - Prior Temporary Location would not be used.

For example, hospital A, hospital B, and hospital C would each keep their own records on a patient, but an A24 link event would be sent to a corporate-wide MPI to enable the coupling of ID information with the corporate ID number. It is used for corporate data repositories, etc. This event is not meant to link mothers and babies since a field exists (PID-21 - Mother's Identifier) for that purpose. See section 3.6.3, \"Patient record links,\" for a discussion of issues related to implementing patient link messages and MPI issues.\r\n\r\nThis event can also be used to link two patient identifiers when a patient changes from inpatient to outpatient, or vice versa. This event can also be used to link two visits of the same patient.\r\n\r\nThe fields included when this message is sent should be the fields pertinent to communicate this event.

Each system has an interest in the database activity of the others in order to maintain data integrity across an institution. Though they are defined within the ADT message set, these messages differ in that they are not patient-specific. To a certain registry, the person may be a person of interest, a potential future patient, or a potential guarantor. For example, these events can be used to maintain an MPI (master patient index), a cancer registry, members of a managed care plan, an HIV database, etc.\r\n\r\nThese events should not replace the use of the A01 (admit/visit notification), A03 (discharge/end visit), A04 (register a patient), A08 (update patient information), etc., events. They are not intended to be used for notification of real-time Patient Administration events. These events are primarily for demographic data, but optional historical non-demographic data may be sent as well.\r\n\r\nThe person whose data is being sent should be identified in the PID segment using the PID-3 - Patient Identifier List, even when the person is not a patient and may be a potential guarantor. An A28 establishes person identifiers, e.g., social security number, guarantor identifier, or other unique identifiers, and contains a person identifier in the PID-3 - Patient Identifier List. The person involved may or may not have active or inactive cases associated with them. When field names and descriptions say \"patient,\" we must translate that to \"person\" for these transactions. In this manner, \"person information\" about a guarantor can be sent independently of the guarantor's relation to any patient.\r\n\r\nFor example, a site with separate inpatient, outpatient and medical records systems may require that each system maintain concurrent person information. Prior to an admit, the new person is added to the master database of the inpatient system, resulting in the broadcast of a message. The outpatient system receives the message and adds the person to its database with the possibility that the person may someday become apatient in its system. The medical records system receives the message and adds the person to its database with the possibility that it will track inpatient, outpatient, or clinical data for that person. The clinical repository database or MPI receives the message to keep all potential patients and guarantors in its database.\r\n\r\nThe A28 event can be used to send everything that is known about a person. For example, it can be sent to an ICU unit (in addition to the A02 (transfer a patient) event) when a patient is transferred to the ICU unit in order to backload all demographic information for the patient into the ICU system. An A28 (add person information) or A31 (update person information) can also be used for backloading MPI information for the person, or for backloading person and historical information.\r\nIn addition to adding a person to a database, the delete, update, and merge messages work in a similar manner to maintain concurrent person information. It is left up to site-specific negotiations to decide how much data must be transmitted or re-transmitted when a person becomes a patient.\r\nTo maintain backward compatibility with previous releases, the PV1 segment is required.

For instance, a detailed financial transaction for an ancillary charge is sent to a billing system that also tracks the transaction(s) in relation to their order via placer order number or wishes to post these transactions with the additional order information. Therefore a service reaches a state where a detailed financial transaction is created and interfaced to other systems along with optional associated order information. If the message contains multiple transactions for the same order, such as a test service and venipuncture charge on the same order, the ordering information is entered in the Order segment construct that precedes the FT1 segments. If a message contains multiple transactions for disparate orders for the same account each FT1 segment construct may contain the order related information specific to that transaction within the message.\r\n\r\nIf the common order information is sent, the Order Control Code should reflect the current state of the common order and is not intended to initiate any order related triggers on the receiving application. For example if observations are included along with common order information the order control code would indicate ‘RE’ as observations to follow.\r\n\r\nIf common order information is sent related to the entire message or a specific financial transaction, the required Order Control Code should reflect the current state of the common order and is not intended to initiate any order related triggers on the receiving application.

If the Payer Application is able to process the Invoice on-line, the EHC^E10 – Edit/Adjudication Results message will contain the Invoice Processing Results portion completely filled out, indicating the results of the adjudication (e.g., paid as submitted, paid partial, etc.).","chapters":["CH_16"]},{"id":"EHC_E12","type":"Message","label":"EHC_E12 - Request Additional Information","description":"A Payer or TPA uses this message to request additional information in support of an Invoice or a (Pre) Authorization Request.  Normally, this request would be sent following receipt of an E01 or E20 message.  However, it can also be sent following receipt of an E04 Re-Assess HealthCare Services Invoice Request.  In this latter case the request for additional information still has as its object the original invoice (which is now under review) rather than the Re-assessment request per se.\r\n\r\nThe E12 can only be used to initiate a request for information and cannot be used to modify, place on hold or cancel an earlier request.  This message cannot be used to convey information on the status of a claim and/or adjudication results (i.e., cannot be used in place of an E10 Edit/Adjudication Results message).\r\n\r\nThe scope of the request for additional information is defined through the inclusion of contextual data from the original Invoice or (Pre) Authorization Request.  By specifying a particular Product/Service Group, patient and/or Product/Service Line item the requested information (e.g., a discharge narrative) is deemed to apply to those particular service events and not to any others which may have been part of the original Invoice or (Pre) Authorization Request.\r\n\r\nIn terms of absolute limits the E12 request is restricted to a single Product/Service Group from the original Invoice or (Pre) Authorization Request.   Thereafter, the context can be more narrowly defined by inclusion of patient and/or Product/Service Line item information from within the same Product/Service Group. Thus, if a particular P/S Line Item is included, the message recipient must interpret this to mean that the request is related to that one line item.  If the P/S Line Item is excluded the request is related to any and all line items in the original Product/Service Group.  Similarly for patients: identification of a particular patient restricts the request to that patient alone, whereas omission of patient information means that the request applies to any and all patients identified in the original Product/Service Group.\r\n\r\nThe E12 message is restricted to zero or one patients and to zero or one Product/Service Line items.  One consequence of these limits is that a Payer requiring information about a variety of patients or products/services from an original invoice may have to generate multiple (E12) requests. \r\n\r\nThe E12 message requires the use of LOINC classification standard to describe the information being requested (as do the E13/14 response messages).  The codified request can also be supplemented by free-form text if greater specificity is required.\r\n\r\nThis message supports the use of pre-defined responses.  That is, the sender specifies both the request as well as a range of possible answers for the recipient to choose from.  This is an optional usage that is designed for real-time environments in which the Payer employs an adjudication engine to both solicit the additional information and manage the responses.","chapters":["CH_16"]},{"id":"EHC_E13","type":"Message","label":"EHC_E13 - Additional Information Response","description":"This message is used by a Provider to immediately respond to an EHC_E12 Request for Additional Information, in other words an automated response.

However, there are occasions when one check number covers multiple Payment/Remittance Advices. This message does not enforce a 1 to 1 relationship between check number and Payment/Remittance Advice.

This process is a major contributor to improving the customers' bottom line by helping to eliminate materials waste, streamline ordering, ensure accurate payment of materials purchased, ensure accurate billing for materials used, and an accurate presentation of the financial statements of a healthcare facility.\r\nMaterial items defined in this message include consumable supplies, devices, surgical sets, and implants.","chapters":["CH_08"]},{"id":"MFN_M17","type":"Message","label":"MFN_M17 - DRG Master File Message","description":"This section is specifically concerned with describing a master file message that should be used to transmit information which identifies the DRG basic information, such as relative weight, lower and upper trim points, etc.\r\nThe DMI segment must be preceded by the MFI and MFE segments, as described in Section 8.5, GENERAL MASTER FILE SEGMENTS.

The first set of RXE segments would typically indicate the drugs which to which the fetus or child was exposed. Additional codes for the route are defined in this Appendix to allow the suspected routes of exposure to be represented. The second set of RXE/RXR segment - those clustered under the NK1 segment - would represent the route by which the mother or father was exposed to the drug. Early spontaneous abortion would normally be treated as an adverse effect on the mother rather than on the fetus, and the PID would refer to the mother. The second set of PRB/OBX segments reflects the problems/observations associated with the individual via which they were exposed.\r\n\r\nEach message contains information about a single case including one patient (PID), at least one sender (PES), one or more events (PEO) and one or more suspected products (PCR and RXE/RXA) for a minimal message. The structure of the message allows actual administration information to be sent in the RXA if known; if administration information is unavailable, or the adverse reaction cannot be related to a single administration event, the RXE segment can be used to send prescription level information. Additional information may be included based on availability and regulatory requirements.\r\n\r\nThe MSH segment specifies the character set (MSH-18) and the language (MSH-19) used in the PEX message.\r\nThe PEX message is designed to accommodate required reporting of adverse product events to the responsible regulatory agencies. In the United States, the paper version of this report is Medwatch.","chapters":["CH_07"]},{"id":"PGL_PC6","type":"Message","label":"PGL_PC6 - PC/ goal add","description":"This message is used to send goals from one application to another (e.g., a point of care system to a clinical repository).

While the messages sent in response to a QVR will reflect events which occurred in the past, the time stamp in the message header will reflect the time the message is actually constructed (current time).  It is also similar to the previous generation VQQ/RQQ Event Replay. \r\n\r\nWhile the response is similar to subscription messages, it differs from subscription in that the response messages are the result of \"interrogating\" the database rather than events being triggered in the current timeframe.\r\nIn a Query for Previous Events, the Server still has to parse the query, but avoids the handshaking protocols required in normal query/response situations. The Server acknowledges the query with the general acknowledgement message ACK. The Server then transmits a sequence of messages as if they were simulated unsolicited messages. This is useful for low end systems that unable to deal with the overhead of the query response message syntax, i.e., systems that can only process unsolicited update messages.\r\n\r\nSystems that choose to offer the QVR should offer guidance in the Query Profile, where appropriate, concerning the scope and size of the data requested by the Client.  Moreover, the Query Profile should contain language cautioning Clients of the potential for harm from getting messages out of the original sequence and/or context.  \r\n\r\nUse cases for this query are as follows: 1) to populate a database initially, 2) to recover from an extended down time on the part of the recipient, or 3) to enable systems which normally receive unsolicited data to be extended to act as a query client with minimal modification.\r\n\r\nNote:  If there is a concern that it will be difficult to distinguish these messages from any current realtime messages, e.g., if they are going down the same pipe, the data offerer might choose to designate a unique MSH-3 Sending application for the messages it sends in response to a QVR. This would allow downstream systems to recognize which messages were the result of the QVR, versus which are the result of current realtime activity on the sending system. For example, there may be 2 systems receiving pharmacy dispense messages. If system A wishes to issue a QVR to receive a historical load, system B might misinterpret the QVR results coming over the pipe as actual live data.

If more than one administration needs to be matched (as in the case of recording a change or rate of an IV solution) the administering application issues additional RXA segment(s) (corresponding to the same RXG segment).

This transaction can be used either to discontinue the blocked status on the schedule, or to reverse a previous block made in error.  For the purposes of this transaction, discontinuing a block currently in progress (the blocked period has started, but not yet completed) and canceling a blocked period in the future are not significantly different.  Therefore, a separate discontinue block transaction is not necessary.  If this transaction is received prior to the inception of a blocked period, then the entire block period is simply canceled according to the data provided in the transaction.
