{"id":"ORG","segmentId":"ORG","longName":"Practitioner Organization Unit Segment","description":"The ORG segment relates a practitioner to an organization unit and adds detailed information regarding the practitioner's practicing specialty in that organization unit.  An ORG segment may optionally follow an STF segment.  An ORG segment must always have been preceded by a corresponding STF segment.  If no organization unit is specified, this segment is used to relate practitioners with their practicing specialties, including effective and end dates.  When it is not necessary to record organization unit or dates associated with the practicing specialty, this data is recorded in PRA-3-Practitioner Category.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_15"],"fields":[{"id":"ORG.1","type":"Field","position":"ORG.1","length":4,"dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Set Id - Org","description":null},{"id":"ORG.2","type":"Field","position":"ORG.2","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0405","tableName":"Organization Unit","name":"Organization Unit Code","description":null},{"id":"ORG.3","type":"Field","position":"ORG.3","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0474","tableName":"Organization Unit Type","name":"Organization Unit Type Code","description":null},{"id":"ORG.4","type":"Field","position":"ORG.4","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","name":"Primary Org Unit Indicator","description":null},{"id":"ORG.5","type":"Field","position":"ORG.5","length":0,"dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id With Check Digit","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Practitioner Org Unit Identifier","description":null},{"id":"ORG.6","type":"Field","position":"ORG.6","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0452","tableName":"Health Care Provider Type Code","name":"Health Care Provider Type Code","description":null},{"id":"ORG.7","type":"Field","position":"ORG.7","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0453","tableName":"Health Care Provider Classification","name":"Health Care Provider Classification Code","description":null},{"id":"ORG.8","type":"Field","position":"ORG.8","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0454","tableName":"Health Care Provider Area of Specialization","name":"Health Care Provider Area Of Specialization Code","description":null},{"id":"ORG.9","type":"Field","position":"ORG.9","length":0,"dataType":"DR","dataTypeName":"Date/time Range","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Effective Date Range","description":null},{"id":"ORG.10","type":"Field","position":"ORG.10","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0066","tableName":"Employment Status","name":"Employment Status Code","description":null},{"id":"ORG.11","type":"Field","position":"ORG.11","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","name":"Board Approval Indicator","description":null},{"id":"ORG.12","type":"Field","position":"ORG.12","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","name":"Primary Care Physician Indicator","description":null},{"id":"ORG.13","type":"Field","position":"ORG.13","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":"0539","tableName":"Cost Center Code","name":"Cost Center Code","description":null}]}
