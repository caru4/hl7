For the purpose of the following discussion these systems will be identified as Imaging Department Information Systems (IDIS).  Information contained in the Imaging Procedure Control (IPC) segment allows multiple IDIS to share the context of Imaging Studies (collections of images acquired, processed, stored, and interpreted) in Image Management tasks.
