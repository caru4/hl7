{"id":"ADT_A43","msgStructId":"ADT_A43","eventDesc":"Move Patient Information - Patient Identifier List","description":"A move has been done at the patient identifier list level.  Identifier to be moved in the PID-3 - Patient Identifier List and MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List will have the same value. The “from” (incorrect source patient ID) and “to” (correct target patient ID) identifiers have different values. See A43 examples in section 5.  The identifiers involved in identifying the patient to be moved (MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List) may or may not have accounts, which may or may not have visits.  In any case, all subordinate data sets associated with the identifier in MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List are moved along with the identifier, from the “incorrect source patient ID” to the “correct target patient ID”. \r\n\r\nNo identifiers subordinate to the identifier (account number, visit number, alternate visit ID) are valued in this message.  Specification of these other subordinate identifiers is not required.
