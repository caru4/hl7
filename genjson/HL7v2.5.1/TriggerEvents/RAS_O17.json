{"id":"RAS_O17","msgStructId":"RAS_O17","eventDesc":"Pharmacy/Treatment Administration","description":"The RAS message may be created by the administering application (e.g., nursing application) for each instance of administration for an existing order.  If the administering application wants to report several administrations of medication/treatment for a given order with a single RAS message, each instance is reported by a separate (repeating) RXA segment.  In addition, the administration records for a group of orders may be sent in a single message by creating repeating groups of segments at the ORC level.
