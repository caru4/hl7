Generally, this request is used by the responder when insufficient data is on hand for a positive match.  In this case, the requester may ask for a list of possible candidates from which to make a selection.  This event code is also used by the responder to signify that the return information contains a list of information rather than information specific to a single patient.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_11"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PROVIDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PRD","name":"PRD","longName":"Provider Data","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"CTD","name":"CTD","longName":"Contact Data","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next of Kin / Associated Parties","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"GUARANTOR INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance Additional Information","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance Additional Information, Certification","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
