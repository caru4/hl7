{"id":"ADT_A28","msgStructId":"ADT_A28","eventDesc":"Add Person or Patient Information","description":"The purpose of this and the three following messages was to allow sites with multiple systems and respective master patient databases to communicate activity related to a person regardless of whether that person is currently a patient on each system.  Each system has an interest in the database activity of the others in order to maintain data integrity across an institution.  Though they are defined within the ADT message set, these messages differ in that they are not patient-specific.  To a certain registry, the person may be a person of interest, a potential future patient, or a potential guarantor.  For example, these events can be used to maintain an MPI (master patient index), a cancer registry, members of a managed care plan, an HIV database, etc. ","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next of Kin / Associated Parties","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","name":"DB1","longName":"Disability","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/Result","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient Allergy Information","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","name":"DRG","longName":"Diagnosis Related Group","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PROCEDURE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","name":"PR1","longName":"Procedures","sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance","sequence":"19","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance Additional Information","sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance Additional Information, Certification","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","name":"ACC","longName":"Accident","sequence":"23","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","name":"UB1","longName":"UB82 Data","sequence":"24","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","name":"UB2","longName":"UB92 Data","sequence":"25","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
