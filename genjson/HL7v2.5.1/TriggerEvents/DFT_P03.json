{"id":"DFT_P03","msgStructId":"DFT_P03","eventDesc":"Post Detail Financial Transactions","description":"The Detail Financial Transaction (DFT) message is used to describe a financial transaction transmitted between systems, that is, to the billing system for ancillary charges, ADT to billing system for patient deposits, etc.\r\n\r\nNote:  The ROL segment is optionally included after the PD1 to transmit information for patient level primary care providers, after the PV2 for additional information on the physicians whose information is sent there (i.e. Attending Doctor, Referring Doctor, Consulting Doctor), and within the insurance construct to transmit information for insurance level primary care providers.\r\n\r\nNote:  There is an information overlap between the FT1, DG1 and PR1 segments.  If diagnosis information is sent in an FT1 segment, it should be consistent with the information contained in any DG1 segments present within its hierarchy. Since the procedure code field within the FT1 does not repeat, if procedure information is sent on an FT1 it is recommended that the single occurrence of the code in FT1 equates to the primary procedure (PR1-14 - Procedure Priority code value 1). \r\n\r\nNote:  The extra set of DG1/DRG/GT1/IN1/IN2/IN3/ROL segments added in V2.4 has been withdrawn as a technical correction","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_06"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit -
