{"id":"CH_15","title":"Personnel Management","description":"The Personnel Management transactions set provides for the transmission of new or updated healthcare administration information about individual healthcare practitioners and supporting staff members.  Since many systems (e.g., security, scheduling, orders, etc.), must be able to closely monitor changes in certain information regarding individual healthcare practitioners, the Personnel Management transaction set is used to clearly identify these events.  For example, it is important to a Security System to be aware of when a staff member was hired or specific role has been terminated.  Prior to Version 2.4, master file updates were the only method to update this information.  However, when any of these changes are reported as master file update notifications, it is not obvious which of the data has been changed, and is cumbersome to process efficiently.  It should be noted that Personnel Management functions that do not affect healthcare administration (e.g. benefits) are not addressed in this chapter."}
