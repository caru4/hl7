{"id":"SIU_S24","msgStructId":"SIU_S24","eventDesc":"Notification of opened (\"unblocked\") schedule time slot(s)","description":"A notification of blocked schedule time slots is sent by the filler application to other applications when a schedule has one or more time slots open up (“un-blocked”) and become available for use.  Typically, the blocked period of time on a schedule is simply allowed to expire, because the blocked amount of time is generally used for non-appointment activities. This transaction can be used either to discontinue the blocked status on the schedule, or to reverse a previous block made in error.
