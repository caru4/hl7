{"id":"ORS_O02","msgStructId":"ORS_O02","eventDesc":"Stock requisition acknowledgment message","description":"Stock supplies are, as the name suggests, stocked in the hospital in designated areas, such as the warehouse, Central Supply, Nursing floors, or Operating Room.\r\n\r\nWhen requisitioning stock supplies, the requesting application need only specify the information in the RQD segment.  It is assumed that this is enough information for the application receiving to identify the item.  If the sending application is not aware whether the supply is stock, it may optionally send an RQ1 along with the RQD.  Typically in that case, the item is requested with a free text description.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message header segment","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","name":"MSA","longName":"Message acknowledgement segment","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","name":"ERR","longName":"Error segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"RESPONSE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common order segment","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RQD","name":"RQD","longName":"Requisition detail","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}
