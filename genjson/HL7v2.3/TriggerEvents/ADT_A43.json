That is, a PID-3-patient ID (internal ID) associated with one external identifier (PID-2-patient ID-external ID) has been moved to another external identifier.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message header segment","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event type","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge patient information","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
