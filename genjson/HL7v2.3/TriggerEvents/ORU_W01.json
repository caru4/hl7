{"id":"ORU_W01","msgStructId":"ORU_W01","eventDesc":"Waveform result, unsolicited transmission of requested information","description":"The waveform response unsolicited trigger event identifies ORU messages used to transmit waveform data which are results of an ordered test or series of observations. The W01 trigger event may also be used to identify ORU messages sent as the eventual response to a QRY message specifying a deferred mode query for waveform results/observations with record-oriented format (similar to the deferred response display mode DSR message type described in Chapter 2).  One or more ORU messages with the W01 trigger event  may result from this type of QRY message.
