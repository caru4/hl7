{"id":"OMS_O01","msgStructId":"OMS_O01","eventDesc":"Stock requisition order message","description":"Stock supplies are, as the name suggests, stocked in the hospital in designated areas, such as the warehouse, Central Supply, Nursing floors, or Operating Room.\r\n\r\nWhen requisitioning stock supplies, the requesting application need only specify the information in the RQD segment.  It is assumed that this is enough information for the application receiving to identify the item.  If the sending application is not aware whether the supply is stock, it may optionally send an RQ1 along with the RQD.  Typically in that case, the item is requested with a free text description.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message header segment","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient visit - additional information","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance additional info","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance additional info - certification","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient Allergy Information","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common order segment","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER DETAIL","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RQD","name":"RQD","longName":"Requisition detail","sequence":"14","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation segment","sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]},{"id":"BLG","name":"BLG","longName":"Billing","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
