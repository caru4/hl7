{"id":"RDF","segmentId":"RDF","longName":"Table Row Definition","description":"The RDF segment defines the content of the row data segments (RDT) in the Tabular Data Response Message (TBR).  It is used in two ways:\r\n \r\n- As an optional segment in the SPQ message (Stored Procedure Request) or the VQQ (Virtual Table Query) message, this segment can be used to limit the number of columns returned and to specify what column positions the fields occupy (where supported, these features can be used to override the defaults for the particular query).  If omitted, all fields defined for the query are returned in their default column order. \r\n- As a required segment on the tabular data response message (TBR), this segment defines the contents of the table row data (RDT) segments that follow.
