{"id":"RGS","segmentId":"RGS","longName":"Resource Group","description":"The RGS segment is used to identify relationships between resources identified for a scheduled event.  This segment can be used, on a site specified basis, to identify groups of resources that are used together within a scheduled event, or to describe some other relationship between resources.  To specify related groups of resources within a message, begin each group with an RGS segment, and then follow that RGS with one or more of the Appointment Information segments (AIG, AIL, AIS, or AIP). \r\nIf a message does not require any grouping of resources, then specify a single RGS in the message, and follow it with all of the Appointment Information segments for the scheduled event.   (At least one RGS segment is required in each message — even if no grouping of resources is required — to allow parsers to properly understand the message.)
