The relational conjunction, defined as follows: If more than one comparison is to be made to select qualifying rows, a conjunction relates this repetition of the field to the next.\r\n\r\n- When applied to strings, the relational operators LT, GT, LE, and GE imply an alphabetic comparison.\r\n\r\n- A “generic” comparison selects a record for inclusion in the response when the beginning of the designated field matches the select string. \r\n\r\n- Where a repeating field is specified as an operand, a match on any instance of that field qualifies the row for inclusion in the response message.\r\n\r\n- AND takes precedence over OR.  More sophisticated precedence rules require that the query be expressed as an embedded query language message or a stored procedure query message (see Section 2.19, “ENHANCED MODE QUERY MESSAGES,” and also Sections 2.24.16, “EQL - embedded query language segment,” and 2.24.20, “SPR - stored procedure request definition segment.”"}]}
