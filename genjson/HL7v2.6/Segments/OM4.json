When an observation or battery requires multiple specimens for their performance (e.g., creatinine clearance requires a 24-hour urine specimen and a serum specimen), multiple segments may be included, one for each specimen type.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_08"],"fields":[{"id":"OM4.1","type":"Field","position":"OM4.1","length":4,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Sequence Number - Test/Observation Master File","description":null},{"id":"OM4.2","type":"Field","position":"OM4.2","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0170","tableName":"Derived specimen","name":"Derived Specimen","description":null},{"id":"OM4.3","type":"Field","position":"OM4.3","length":60,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Container Description","description":null},{"id":"OM4.4","type":"Field","position":"OM4.4","length":20,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Container Volume","description":null},{"id":"OM4.5","type":"Field","position":"OM4.5","length":250,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded with Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Container Units","description":null},{"id":"OM4.6","type":"Field","position":"OM4.6","length":250,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded with Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Specimen","description":null},{"id":"OM4.7","type":"Field","position":"OM4.7","length":705,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded with Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0371","tableName":"Additive/Preservative","name":"Additive","description":null},{"id":"OM4.8","type":"Field","position":"OM4.8","length":10240,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Preparation","description":null},{"id":"OM4.9","type":"Field","position":"OM4.9","length":10240,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Special Handling Requirements","description":null},{"id":"OM4.10","type":"Field","position":"OM4.10","length":20,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Normal Collection Volume","description":null},{"id":"OM4.11","type":"Field","position":"OM4.11","length":20,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Minimum Collection Volume","description":null},{"id":"OM4.12","type":"Field","position":"OM4.12","length":10240,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Specimen Requirements","description":null},{"id":"OM4.13","type":"Field","position":"OM4.13","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":"0027","tableName":"Priority","name":"Specimen Priorities","description":null},{"id":"OM4.14","type":"Field","position":"OM4.14","length":20,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity with Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Specimen Retention Time","description":null}]}
