{"id":"RPT","type":"DataType","name":"Repeat Pattern","description":"The repeat pattern data type should be used where it is necessary to define the frequency at which an event is to take place. This data type provides a way to define repeat pattern codes \"on the fly\". The repeat pattern code is equivalent to the TQ data type, component 2, sub-component 1 (repeat pattern). The additional components define the meaning of the repeat pattern code. Components 2 - 10 are used to define relatively simple repeat patterns. Component 11 is provided to define complex repeat patterns. This data type forms a bridge between the 2.x Repeat Pattern concept from Quantity/Timing, and the Version 3.0 GTS General Timing Specification. Component 1 is the 2.x concept of repeat pattern. Components 2-7 are derived from the version 3.0 data type PIVL. Components 8-10 are derived from the version 3.0 EIVL data type. If a repeat pattern cannot be defined using components 2-10, then component 11, General Timing Specification is provided. This allows the full literal form of the version 3.0 GTS to be specified.","dataType":null,"dataTypeName":null,"length":984,"usage":null,"rpt":null,"tableId":null,"tableName":null,"sample":"","fields":[{"id":"RPT.1","type":"DataTypeComponent","position":"RPT.1","length":705,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded with Exceptions","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":"0335","tableName":"Repeat pattern","name":"Repeat Pattern Code","description":"A code representing the repeat pattern defined by the other components of this data type.
