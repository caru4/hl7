{"id":"QVR_Q17","msgStructId":"QVR_Q17","eventDesc":"Query for Previous Events","description":"The Query for Previous Events is like a Query by Parameter with a Segment Pattern Response except that the response consists of zero to many messages of the type defined in the Query Profile rather than a single response message containing multiple iterations of the segment pattern.  While the messages sent in response to a QVR will reflect events which occurred in the past, the time stamp in the message header will reflect the time the message is actually constructed (current time).  It is also similar to the previous generation VQQ/RQQ Event Replay.
