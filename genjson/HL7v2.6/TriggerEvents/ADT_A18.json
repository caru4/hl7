{"id":"ADT_A18","msgStructId":"ADT_A18","eventDesc":"Merge Patient Information","description":"Event A18 has been retained for backward compatibility only in version 2.3.1.  The A18 event was used to merge current and previous patient identification numbers: PID-3 - Patient Identifier List, PID-2 - Patient ID, PID-4 - Alternate Patient ID-PID, and PID-18 - Patient Account Number.  This procedure is required, for example, when a previous patient is registered under a new patient identification number because of an error, or because there was insufficient time to determine the actual patient identification number.  The merge event occurs when a decision is made to combine the information under either the new or the old identifier(s).  The PID segment contains the surviving patient ID information.  The MRG segment contains the non-surviving information.\r\n\r\nFrom V2.3.1 onwards events A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list), A41 (merge account-patient account number), and A42 (merge visit-visit number) should be utilized in place of the A18 event.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge Patient Information","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
