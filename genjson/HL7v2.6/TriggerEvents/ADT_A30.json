{"id":"ADT_A30","msgStructId":"ADT_A30","eventDesc":"Merge Person Information","description":"Event A30 has been retained for backward compatibility only.  An A30 event was used to merge person information on an MPI.  From V 2.3.1 onwards, the A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list) events should be used to merge patient information for a current episode.  The \"incorrect MRN\" identified on the MRG segment (MRG-1 - Prior Patient Identifier List) is to be merged with the \"correct MRN\" identified on the PID segment (PID-3 - Patient Identifier List).  The \"incorrect MRN\" then no longer exists.  All PID data associated with the \"correct MRN\" are treated as updated information.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge Patient Information","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
