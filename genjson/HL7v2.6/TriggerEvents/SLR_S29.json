If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_17"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SLT","name":"SLT","longName":"Sterilization Lot Segment","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
