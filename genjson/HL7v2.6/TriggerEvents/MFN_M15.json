{"id":"MFN_M15","msgStructId":"MFN_M15","eventDesc":"Inventory Item Master File Notification","description":"This section is concerned with describing a master file message that should be used to communicate information that relates to the inventory of items that can be used to perform an ordered service.  While an order specifies a service that is represented in an Other Observation/Service Item master file, this message is concerned with communicating attributes of those orderable items (for example lot number and expiration date) that are represented in the Other Observation/Service Item master file.  These attributes are more granular than can be represented in the Other Observation/Service Item master file as there may be multiple items in inventory that meet the characteristics of the Service Item but have different specific characteristics, e.g., multiple lots of a vaccine.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_08"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MFI","name":"MFI","longName":"Master File Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"MF INV ITEM","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"MFE","name":"MFE","longName":"Master File Entry","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IIM","name":"IIM","longName":"Inventory Item Master","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
