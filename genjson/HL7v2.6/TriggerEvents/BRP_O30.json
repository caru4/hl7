Examples of pre-transfusion processing include performing a crossmatch test to ensure compatibility with the patient, or irradiation of the blood product due to a special transfusion requirement for the patient. The blood product dispense status messages need to contain additional information regarding the blood products requested, such as the Donation ID, product code, blood type, expiration date/time and current status of the blood product.\r\n\r\nIn the processing of commercial blood products, such as Rh Immune Globulin, Factor Concentrate, or Albumin Products, the status messages need to contain additional information, such as the lot number and manufacturer, expiration date and status of the commercial product.\r\n\r\nBlood product dispense status messages use the BPS and BRP messages as described below","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","name":"MSA","longName":"Message Acknowledgment","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","name":"ERR","longName":"Error","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"RESPONSE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common Order","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"TIMING","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"TQ1","name":"TQ1","longName":"Timing/Quantity","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"TQ2","name":"TQ2","longName":"Timing/Quantity Relationship","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"BPO","name":"BPO","longName":"Blood product order","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"BPX","name":"BPX","longName":"Blood product dispense status","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}]}
