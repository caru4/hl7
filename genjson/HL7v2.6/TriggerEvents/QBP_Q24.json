{"id":"QBP_Q24","msgStructId":"QBP_Q24","eventDesc":"Allocate Identifiers Query","description":"This query/response is designed for interaction between a client system and an MPI (Master Person Index). The query consists of domains in which identifiers should be allocated. The response is new identifiers in those domains.\r\n\r\nThis event is not meant to cause the creation of a new person record, or to bind identifiers to a particular person record. The events A28 - Add person information and A24 - Link patient information should be used for that purpose. This event is meant to simply reserve the use of identifiers.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03","CH_05"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QPD","name":"QPD","longName":"Query Parameter Definition","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RCP","name":"RCP","longName":"Response Control Parameter","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DSC","name":"DSC","longName":"Continuation Pointer","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
