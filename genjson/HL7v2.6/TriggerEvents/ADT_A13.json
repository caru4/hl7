PV1-3 - Assigned Patient Location should reflect the location of the patient after the cancellation has been processed.  Note that this location may be different from the patient's location prior to the erroneous discharge.  Prior Location could be used to show the location of the patient prior to the erroneous discharge.\r\n\r\nNote from the Caristix team: ADT_A13.7 (ARV) does not exist in the documentation for HL7 v2.6, but it should exist given the structure of ADT_A01.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restrictions","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next of Kin / Associated Parties","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restrictions","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","name":"DB1","longName":"Disability","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/Result","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient Allergy Information","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","name":"DRG","longName":"Diagnosis Related Group","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PROCEDURE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","name":"PR1","longName":"Procedures","sequence":"19","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance","sequence":"22","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance Additional Information","sequence":"23","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance Additional Information, Certification","sequence":"24","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"25","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","name":"ACC","longName":"Accident","sequence":"26","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","name":"UB1","longName":"Uniform Billing 1","sequence":"27","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","name":"UB2","longName":"UB92 Data","sequence":"28","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PDA","name":"PDA","longName":"Patient Death and Autopsy","sequence":"29","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
