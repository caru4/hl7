{"id":"EHC_E15","msgStructId":"EHC_E15","eventDesc":"Payment/Remittance Advice","description":"This message is used to send a payment/ remittance advice to a Payee for the payment of HealthCare Services Invoices and/or other adjustments.   The Payment/Remittance Advice can be sent to the originating Provider Application (Network Application ID) or alternately to the Payee's Network Application ID, depending on how the Payee has been configured by the Payer. If a Payment/Remittance Advice is paid by check, it typically has a 1 to 1 correspondence with a check number. However, there are occasions when one check number covers multiple Payment/Remittance Advices. This message does not enforce a 1 to 1 relationship between check number and Payment/Remittance Advice. That is, the same check number (Check Number on PMT) can be used on multiple Payment/Remittance Advices.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_16"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PAYMENT REMITTANCE HEADER INFO","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PMT","name":"PMT","longName":"Payment Information","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PYE","name":"PYE","longName":"Payee Information","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"PAYMENT REMITTANCE DETAIL INFO","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IPR","name":"IPR","longName":"Invoice Processing Results","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IVC","name":"IVC","longName":"Invoice","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PRODUCT SERVICE SECTION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSS","name":"PSS","longName":"Product/Service Section","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PRODUCT SERVICE GROUP","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSG","name":"PSG","longName":"Product/Service Group","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PSL ITEM INFO","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSL","name":"PSL","longName":"Product/Service Line Item","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ADJ","name":"ADJ","longName":"Adjustment","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}]},{"id":null,"name":"ADJUSTMENT PAYEE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ADJ","name":"ADJ","longName":"Adjustment","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
