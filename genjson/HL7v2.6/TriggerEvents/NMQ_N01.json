It has three segments, the NCK segment (system clock), the NST segment (application control-level statistics), and the NSC segment (application control-level status change). At least one of these three segments must be present in the NMQ message. If a segment is present in the NMQ message, the corresponding segment needs to be present in the NMR message to return the requested data or status.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_14"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"QRY WITH DETAIL","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"QRD","name":"QRD","longName":"Original-Style Query Definition","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"QRF","name":"QRF","longName":"Original style query filter","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"CLOCK AND STATISTICS","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"NCK","name":"NCK","longName":"System Clock","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NST","name":"NST","longName":"Application control level statistics","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NSC","name":"NSC","longName":"Application Status Change","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
