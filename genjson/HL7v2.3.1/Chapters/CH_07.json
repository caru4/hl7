{"id":"CH_07","title":"Observation Reporting","description":"This chapter describes the transaction set required for sending structured patient oriented clinical data from one computer system to another.  A common use of these transaction sets will be to transmit observations and results of diagnostic studies from the producing system (e.g., clinical laboratory system, EKG system) (the filler), to the ordering system (e.g., HIS order entry, physician's office system) (the placer).  However, the transaction set is not limited to such transactions.  Observations can be sent from producing systems to archival medical record systems ( not necessarily the order placer) and from such medical record systems to other systems that were not part of the ordering loop, e.g., an office practice system of the referring physician for inpatient test results ordered by an inpatient surgeon."}
