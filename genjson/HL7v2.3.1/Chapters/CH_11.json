{"id":"CH_11","title":"Patient Referral","description":"The Patient Referral chapter defines the message set used in patient referral communications between mutually exclusive healthcare entities.  These referral transactions frequently occur between entities with different methods and systems of capturing and storing data.  Such transactions frequently traverse a path connecting primary care providers, specialists, payors, government agencies, hospitals, labs, and other healthcare entities.  The availability, completeness, and currency of information for a given patient will vary greatly across such a spectrum."}
