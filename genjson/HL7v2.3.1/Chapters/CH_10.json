{"id":"CH_10","title":"Scheduling","description":"This chapter defines abstract messages for the purpose of communicating various events related to the scheduling of appointments for services or for the use of resources.  There are three basic types of messages defined in this transaction set:  request transactions and their responses, query transactions and their responses, and unsolicited transactions and their responses.  Request transactions communicate requests for the scheduling of appointments for services or for the use of resources.  These transactions occur between placer (requesting) applications and filler (processing) applications.  The query and unsolicited transaction sets provide for the exchange of scheduling information between systems.  The exchange of this information is achieved either actively or passively.  The active gathering of scheduling information is performed by issuing query transactions to a filler application from a querying application.  The passive gathering of this information is performed by accepting unsolicited transactions issued by a filler application."}
