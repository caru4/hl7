{"id":"CH_12","title":"Patient Care","description":"The Patient Care Technical Committee has designed the following messages to support the communication of problem-oriented records, including clinical problems, goals, and pathway information between computer systems.  The purpose of this chapter is to describe healthcare messages that need to be communicated between clinical applications for a given individual.  These message transactions can be sent in either batch or online mode.  As described in Chapter 2, multiple communication transactions may be grouped and sent between applications using a file transfer media or direct networked connection."}
