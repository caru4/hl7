{"id":"CDM","segmentId":"CDM","longName":"Charge description master segment","description":"The CDM segment contains the fields for identifying anything which is charged to patient accounts, including procedures, services, supplies. It is intended to be used to maintain a list of valid chargeable utilization items. Its purpose is to keep billing codes synchronized between HIS, Patient Accounting, and other departmental systems. It is not intended to completely support materials management, inventory, or complex pricing structures for which additional complex fields would be required. Given an identifying charge code, the associated fields in the charge description master file will provide basic pricing and billing data. All the additional information necessary for patient accounting systems to do billing and claims is not intended to be included in this segment; those should be part of insurance or billing profile tables.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_08"],"fields":[{"id":"CDM.1","type":"Field","position":"CDM.1","length":200,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":"0132","tableName":"Transaction code","name":"Primary Key Value - CDM","description":null},{"id":"CDM.2","type":"Field","position":"CDM.2","length":200,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Charge Code Alias","description":null},{"id":"CDM.3","type":"Field","position":"CDM.3","length":20,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Charge Description Short","description":null},{"id":"CDM.4","type":"Field","position":"CDM.4","length":250,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Charge Description Long","description":null},{"id":"CDM.5","type":"Field","position":"CDM.5","length":1,"dataType":"IS","dataTypeName":"Coded value for user-defined tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0268","tableName":"Override","name":"Description Override Indicator","description":null},{"id":"CDM.6","type":"Field","position":"CDM.6","length":60,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Exploding Charges","description":null},{"id":"CDM.7","type":"Field","position":"CDM.7","length":80,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":"0088","tableName":"Procedure code","name":"Procedure Code","description":null},{"id":"CDM.8","type":"Field","position":"CDM.8","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0183","tableName":"Active/Inactive","name":"Active/Inactive Flag","description":null},{"id":"CDM.9","type":"Field","position":"CDM.9","length":60,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Inventory Number","description":null},{"id":"CDM.10","type":"Field","position":"CDM.10","length":12,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Resource Load","description":null},{"id":"CDM.11","type":"Field","position":"CDM.11","length":200,"dataType":"CK","dataTypeName":"Composite ID With Check Digit","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Contract Number","description":null},{"id":"CDM.12","type":"Field","position":"CDM.12","length":200,"dataType":"XON","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Name And Identification Number For Organizations","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Contract Organization","description":null},{"id":"CDM.13","type":"Field","position":"CDM.13","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded values for HL7 tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no indicator","name":"Room Fee Indicator","description":null}]}
