{"id":"RAS_O01","msgStructId":"RAS_O01","eventDesc":"Pharmacy/treatment administration message","description":"The RAS message may be created by the administering application (e.g., nursing application) for each instance of administration for an existing order.  If the administering application wants to report several administrations of medication for a given order with a single RAS message, each instance is reported by a separate (repeating) RXA segment.  In addition, the administration records for a group of orders may be sent in a single message by creating repeating groups of segments at the ORC level.\r\nrra","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message header segment","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification segment","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient allergy information segment","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit segment","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient visit - additional information segment","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common order segment","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER DETAIL","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXO","name":"RXO","longName":"Pharmacy/treatment order segment","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER DETAIL SUPPLEMENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy/treatment route segment","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"COMPONENTS","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXC","name":"RXC","longName":"Pharmacy/treatment component order segment","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]},{"id":null,"name":"ENCODING","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXE","name":"RXE","longName":"Pharmacy/treatment encoded order segment","sequence":"15","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy/treatment route segment","sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXC","name":"RXC","longName":"Pharmacy/treatment component order segment","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"RXA","name":"RXA","longName":"Pharmacy/treatment administration segment","sequence":"18","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy/treatment route segment","sequence":"19","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result segment","sequence":"20","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"CTI","name":"CTI","longName":"Clinical trial identification segment","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
