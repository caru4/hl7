{"id":"ADT_A28","msgStructId":"ADT_A28","eventDesc":"Add person information","description":"The A28 event can be used to send everything that is known about a person.  For example, it can be sent to an ICU unit (in addition to the A02 (transfer a patient) event) when a patient is transferred to the ICU unit in order to backload all demographic information for the patient into the ICU system.  An A28 (add person information) or A31 (update person information) can also be used for backloading MPI information for the person, or for backloading person and historical information.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message header segment","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event type segment","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification segment","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next of kin / associated parties segment","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit segment","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient visit - additional information segment","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","name":"DB1","longName":"Disability segment","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result segment","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient allergy information segment","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis segment","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","name":"DRG","longName":"Diagnosis related group segment","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PROCEDURE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","name":"PR1","longName":"Procedures segment","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor segment","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance segment","sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance additional information segment","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance additional information, certification segment","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","name":"ACC","longName":"Accident segment","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","name":"UB1","longName":"UB82 data segment","sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","name":"UB2","longName":"UB92 data segment","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
