This trigger event is used to request the modification of information on an existing appointment, outside of the need to reschedule, cancel, discontinue or delete the appointment, or to add, modify, cancel, discontinue, or delete services and/or resources on the appointment.  This trigger event should only be used for appointments that have not been completed, or for parent appointments whose children have not been completed. If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned, optionally containing an SCH segment and related detail segments describing the new information for the modified appointment.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_10"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message header segment","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","name":"MSA","longName":"Message acknowledgment segment","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","name":"ERR","longName":"Error segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"SCHEDULE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"SCH","name":"SCH","longName":"Schedule activity information segment","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification segment","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit segment","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient visit - additional information segment","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis segment","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"RESOURCES","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RGS","name":"RGS","longName":"Resource group segment","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"SERVICE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIS","name":"AIS","longName":"Appointment information - service segment","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"GENERAL RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIG","name":"AIG","longName":"Appointment information - general resource segment","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"LOCATION RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIL","name":"AIL","longName":"Appointment information - location resource segment","sequence":"15","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"PERSONNEL RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIP","name":"AIP","longName":"Appointment information - personnel resource segment","sequence":"17","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and comments segment","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}]}
