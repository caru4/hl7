{"id":"ORG","segmentId":"ORG","longName":"Practitioner Organization Unit","description":"The ORG segment relates a practitioner to an organization unit and adds detailed information regarding the practitioner's practicing specialty in that organization unit. An ORG segment may optionally follow an STF segment. An ORG segment must always have been preceded by a corresponding STF segment.
