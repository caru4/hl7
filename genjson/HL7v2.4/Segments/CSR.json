{"id":"CSR","segmentId":"CSR","longName":"Clinical Study Registration","description":"The CSR segment will contain fundamental administrative and regulatory information required to document a patients enrollment on a clinical trial. This segment is all that is required if one needs to message another system that an enrollment has taken place, i.e., from clinical trials to pharmacy, accounting, or order entry systems. The CSR segment may also be used to identify that OBR, OBX, RXA, and RXR segments that follow represent data applicable to the identified study.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"CSR.1","type":"Field","position":"CSR.1","length":60,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Sponsor Study ID","description":null},{"id":"CSR.2","type":"Field","position":"CSR.2","length":60,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Alternate Study ID","description":null},{"id":"CSR.3","type":"Field","position":"CSR.3","length":250,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Institution Registering the Patient","description":null},{"id":"CSR.4","type":"Field","position":"CSR.4","length":30,"dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite ID With Check Digit","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Sponsor Patient ID","description":null},{"id":"CSR.5","type":"Field","position":"CSR.5","length":30,"dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite ID With Check Digit","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Alternate Patient ID - CSR","description":null},{"id":"CSR.6","type":"Field","position":"CSR.6","length":26,"dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Date/Time Of Patient Study Registration","description":null},{"id":"CSR.7","type":"Field","position":"CSR.7","length":250,"dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite ID Number And Name For Persons","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Person Performing Study Registration","description":null},{"id":"CSR.8","type":"Field","position":"CSR.8","length":250,"dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite ID Number And Name For Persons","usage":"R","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Study Authorizing Provider","description":null},{"id":"CSR.9","type":"Field","position":"CSR.9","length":26,"dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Date/time Patient Study Consent Signed","description":null},{"id":"CSR.10","type":"Field","position":"CSR.10","length":250,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Patient Study Eligibility Status","description":null},{"id":"CSR.11","type":"Field","position":"CSR.11","length":26,"dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","usage":"O","rpt":"3","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Study Randomization Date/time","description":null},{"id":"CSR.12","type":"Field","position":"CSR.12","length":250,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"O","rpt":"3","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Randomized Study Arm","description":null},{"id":"CSR.13","type":"Field","position":"CSR.13","length":250,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"O","rpt":"3","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Stratum for Study Randomization","description":null},{"id":"CSR.14","type":"Field","position":"CSR.14","length":250,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Patient Evaluability Status","description":null},{"id":"CSR.15","type":"Field","position":"CSR.15","length":26,"dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Date/time Ended Study","description":null},{"id":"CSR.16","type":"Field","position":"CSR.16","length":250,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Reason Ended Study","description":null}]}
