{"id":"CSS","segmentId":"CSS","longName":"Clinical Study Data Schedule Segment","description":"The Clinical Study Data Schedule (CSS) segment is optional depending on whether messaging of study data needs to be linked to the scheduled data time points for the study. (See Section 7.6.1.3, data schedule.) The CSS segment enables communication of data schedules and adherence that ranges from the basic to the elaborate. Use of the segment must be planned for each implementation. Each CSS segment will subsume observation and drug administration segments that follow, indicating that they satisfy this scheduled time point.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"CSS.1","type":"Field","position":"CSS.1","length":250,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Study Scheduled Time Point","description":null},{"id":"CSS.2","type":"Field","position":"CSS.2","length":26,"dataType":"TS","dataTypeName":"Time Stamp","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Study Scheduled Patient Time Point","description":null},{"id":"CSS.3","type":"Field","position":"CSS.3","length":250,"dataType":"CE","dataTypeName":"Coded Element","usage":"O","rpt":"3","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Study Quality Control Codes","description":null}]}
