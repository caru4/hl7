If the time of the order spans more than a single day, this new subcomponent is only practical if the same times of administration occur for each day of the order.  If the actual start time of the order (as given by the fourth subcomponent of the quantity/timing field) is after the first explicit time, the first administration is taken to be the first explicit time after the start time.  In the case where the patient moves to a location having a different set of explicit times, the existing order may be updated with a new quantity/timing field showing the changed explicit times."}]}
