{"id":"ADT_A18","msgStructId":"ADT_A18","eventDesc":"Merge patient information","description":"Event A18 has been retained for backward compatibility.  The A18 event was used to merge current and previous patient identification numbers: PID-3 - patient identifier list, PID-2 - patient ID, PID-4 alternate patient ID-PID, and PID-18 - patient account number.  This procedure is required, for example, when a previous patient is registered under a new patient identification number because of an error, or because there was insufficient time to determine the actual patient identification number.  The merge event occurs when a decision is made to combine the information under either the new or the old identifier(s).  The PID segment contains the surviving patient ID information.  The MRG segment contains the non-surviving information.\r\n\r\nFrom V2.3.1 onwards events A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list), A41 (merge account-patient account number), and A42 (merge visit-visit number) should be utilized in place of the A18 event.\r\n\r\nThis merge event is non-specific in that, as a result of the merge, several patient identifiers may or may not have changed.  For sites requiring (or desiring) greater specificity with regard to this type of message, new events A40 (merge patient-patient identifier list), A41 (merge account-patient account number) and A42 (merge visit-visit number)) are now available as alternatives.
