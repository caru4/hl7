{"id":"SRM_S06","msgStructId":"SRM_S06","eventDesc":"Schedule request - Appointment deletion","description":"A request appointment deletion is sent by the placer application to the filler application to request that an appointment that had been entered in error be removed from the system.  A delete trigger event should only be used when an appointment has been erroneously requested, and must be removed from the schedule so that it does not affect any statistical processing.  A delete trigger event differs from a cancel trigger event in that a delete acts to remove an error, whereas a cancel acts to prevent a valid request from occurring.  This trigger event should not be used for any appointment that has already begun, or has already been completed.  Likewise, it should not be used on any parent appointment if any child appointments have either begun or been completed.  If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned, optionally containing an SCH segment and related detail segments describing the deleted appointment.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_10"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARQ","name":"ARQ","longName":"Appointment Request","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient visit - additional information","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/Result","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"RESOURCES","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RGS","name":"RGS","longName":"Resource Group","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"SERVICE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIS","name":"AIS","longName":"Appointment Information - Service","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"GENERAL RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIG","name":"AIG","longName":"Appointment Information - General Resource","sequence":"14","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"LOCATION RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIL","name":"AIL","longName":"Appointment Information - Location Resource","sequence":"17","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"PERSONNEL RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIP","name":"AIP","longName":"Appointment Information - Personnel Resource","sequence":"20","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}
