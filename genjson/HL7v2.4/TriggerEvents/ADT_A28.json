{"id":"ADT_A28","msgStructId":"ADT_A28","eventDesc":"Add person information","description":"The A28 event can be used to send everything that is known about a person.  For example, it can be sent to an ICU unit (in addition to the A02 (transfer a patient) event) when a patient is transferred to the ICU unit in order to backload all demographic information for the patient into the ICU system.  An A28 (add person information) or A31 (update person information) can also be used for backloading MPI information for the person, or for backloading person and historical information.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next of kin / associated parties","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient visit - additional information","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DB1","name":"DB1","longName":"Disability","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/Result","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient allergy information","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DRG","name":"DRG","longName":"Diagnosis Related Group","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PROCEDURE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PR1","name":"PR1","longName":"Procedures","sequence":"15","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance","sequence":"18","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance Additional Information","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance Additional Information, Certification","sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ROL","name":"ROL","longName":"Role","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ACC","name":"ACC","longName":"Accident","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB1","name":"UB1","longName":"UB82","sequence":"23","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UB2","name":"UB2","longName":"UB92 Data","sequence":"24","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}
