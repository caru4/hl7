If the administering application wants to report several administrations of medication/treatment for a given order with a single RAS message, each instance is reported by a separate (repeating) RXA segment.  In addition, the administration records for a group of orders may be sent in a single message by creating repeating groups of segments at the ORC level.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","name":"MSA","longName":"Message Acknowledgment","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","name":"ERR","longName":"Error","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"RESPONSE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common Order","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ADMINISTRATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXA","name":"RXA","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Administration","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Route","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}]}
