{"id":"ADT_A39","msgStructId":"ADT_A39","eventDesc":"Merge person - patient id","description":"An A39 event is used to signal a merge of records for a person that was incorrectly filed under two different PID-2 - patient IDs.  The \"incorrect source patient ID\" identified in the MRG segment (MRG-4 prior patient ID) is to be merged with the required \"correct target patient ID\" identified in the PID segment (PID-2 - patient ID).  The \"incorrect source patient ID\" would then logically never be referenced in future transactions.  It is noted that some systems may still physically keep this \"incorrect identifier\" for audit trail purposes or other reasons associated with database index implementation requirements.\r\n\r\nEvent A39 has been retained for backward compatibility only. From V2.3.1 onwards, event A40 (merge patient - patient identifier list) should be used instead. A merge has been done at the patient identifier level.  That is, two PID-2 - patient ID identifiers have been merged into one.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_03"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"EVN","name":"EVN","longName":"Event Type","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MRG","name":"MRG","longName":"Merge patient information","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
