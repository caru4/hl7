In the most common case, the RDS messages would be routed to a Nursing application or to some clinical application, which needs the data about drugs dispensed or treatments given.  As a site-specific variant, the original order segments (RXO, RXE and their associated RXR/RXCs) may be sent optionally (for comparison).","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification","sequence":"3","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient allergy information","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient visit - additional information","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common Order","sequence":"9","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER DETAIL","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXO","name":"RXO","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Order","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER DETAIL SUPPLEMENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Route","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"COMPONENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXC","name":"RXC","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Component Order","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]},{"id":null,"name":"ENCODING","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RXE","name":"RXE","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Encoded Order","sequence":"15","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Route","sequence":"16","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXC","name":"RXC","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Component Order","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"RXD","name":"RXD","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Dispense","sequence":"18","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXR","name":"RXR","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Route","sequence":"19","usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"RXC","name":"RXC","longName":"Pharmacy/Treatment Component Order","sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/Result","sequence":"21","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"FT1","name":"FT1","longName":"Financial Transaction","sequence":"23","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
