{"id":"SRM_S04","msgStructId":"SRM_S04","eventDesc":"Schedule request - Appointment cancellation","description":"The request appointment cancellation trigger event is sent by the placer application to the filler application to request that an existing appointment be canceled.  A cancel event is used to stop a valid appointment from occurring.  For example, if a patient scheduled for an exam cancels his/her appointment, then a request to cancel the appointment is sent.  If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned, optionally containing an SCH segment and related detail segments describing the canceled appointment.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_10"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARQ","name":"ARQ","longName":"Appointment Request","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient visit","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient visit - additional information","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/Result","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"RESOURCES","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RGS","name":"RGS","longName":"Resource Group","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"SERVICE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIS","name":"AIS","longName":"Appointment Information - Service","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"GENERAL RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIG","name":"AIG","longName":"Appointment Information - General Resource","sequence":"14","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"LOCATION RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIL","name":"AIL","longName":"Appointment Information - Location Resource","sequence":"17","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"PERSONNEL RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIP","name":"AIP","longName":"Appointment Information - Personnel Resource","sequence":"20","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes and Comments","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}
