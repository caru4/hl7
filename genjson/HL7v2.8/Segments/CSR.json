{"id":"CSR","segmentId":"CSR","longName":"Clinical Study Registration","description":"The CSR segment will contain fundamental administrative and regulatory information required to document a patientâ€™s enrollment on a clinical trial. This segment is all that is required if one needs to message another system that an enrollment has taken place, i.e., from clinical trials to pharmacy, accounting, or order entry systems. The CSR segment may also be used to identify that OBR, OBX, RXA, and RXR segments that follow represent data applicable to the identified study.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_07"],"fields":[{"id":"CSR.1","type":"Field","position":"CSR.1","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Sponsor Study Id","description":null},{"id":"CSR.2","type":"Field","position":"CSR.2","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Alternate Study Id","description":null},{"id":"CSR.3","type":"Field","position":"CSR.3","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Institution Registering The Patient","description":null},{"id":"CSR.4","type":"Field","position":"CSR.4","length":0,"dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id With Check Digit","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Sponsor Patient Id","description":null},{"id":"CSR.5","type":"Field","position":"CSR.5","length":0,"dataType":"CX","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id With Check Digit","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Alternate Patient Id - Csr","description":null},{"id":"CSR.6","type":"Field","position":"CSR.6","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Date/Time Of Patient Study Registration","description":null},{"id":"CSR.7","type":"Field","position":"CSR.7","length":0,"dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Person Performing Study Registration","description":null},{"id":"CSR.8","type":"Field","position":"CSR.8","length":0,"dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","usage":"R","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Study Authorizing Provider","description":null},{"id":"CSR.9","type":"Field","position":"CSR.9","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Date/Time Patient Study Consent Signed","description":null},{"id":"CSR.10","type":"Field","position":"CSR.10","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Patient Study Eligibility Status","description":null},{"id":"CSR.11","type":"Field","position":"CSR.11","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"O","rpt":"3","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Study Randomization Date/Time","description":null},{"id":"CSR.12","type":"Field","position":"CSR.12","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"3","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Randomized Study Arm","description":null},{"id":"CSR.13","type":"Field","position":"CSR.13","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"3","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Stratum For Study Randomization","description":null},{"id":"CSR.14","type":"Field","position":"CSR.14","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Patient Evaluability Status","description":null},{"id":"CSR.15","type":"Field","position":"CSR.15","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Date/Time Ended Study","description":null},{"id":"CSR.16","type":"Field","position":"CSR.16","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Reason Ended Study","description":null}]}
