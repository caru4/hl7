{"id":"OM4","segmentId":"OM4","longName":"Observations That Require Specimens","description":"This segment applies to observations/batteries that require a specimen for their performance.  When an observation or battery requires multiple specimens for their performance (e.g., creatinine clearance requires a 24-hour urine specimen and a serum specimen), multiple segments may be included, one for each specimen type.\r\n\r\nOM4 is a repeating segment.  It allows multiple specimens per Order Code and accommodates for multiple alternate specimen for each preferred specimen.  In some cases an Order Code can require multiple specimens.  In many cases there are preferred specimens and for each preferred it is possible to have one or more alternative specimens.  The alternative specimen will carry in OM4-17 the Sequence Number â€“ Test/Observation Master File (OM4-1) of the preferred specimen.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_08"],"fields":[{"id":"OM4.1","type":"Field","position":"OM4.1","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Sequence Number - Test/Observation Master File","description":null},{"id":"OM4.2","type":"Field","position":"OM4.2","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0170","tableName":"Derived Specimen","name":"Derived Specimen","description":null},{"id":"OM4.3","type":"Field","position":"OM4.3","length":60,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Container Description","description":null},{"id":"OM4.4","type":"Field","position":"OM4.4","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Container Volume","description":null},{"id":"OM4.5","type":"Field","position":"OM4.5","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Container Units","description":null},{"id":"OM4.6","type":"Field","position":"OM4.6","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Specimen","description":null},{"id":"OM4.7","type":"Field","position":"OM4.7","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0371","tableName":"Additive/Preservative","name":"Additive","description":null},{"id":"OM4.8","type":"Field","position":"OM4.8","length":0,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Preparation","description":null},{"id":"OM4.9","type":"Field","position":"OM4.9","length":0,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Special Handling Requirements","description":null},{"id":"OM4.10","type":"Field","position":"OM4.10","length":0,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Normal Collection Volume","description":null},{"id":"OM4.11","type":"Field","position":"OM4.11","length":0,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Minimum Collection Volume","description":null},{"id":"OM4.12","type":"Field","position":"OM4.12","length":0,"dataType":"TX","dataTypeName":"Text Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Specimen Requirements","description":null},{"id":"OM4.13","type":"Field","position":"OM4.13","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":"0027","tableName":"Priority","name":"Specimen Priorities","description":null},{"id":"OM4.14","type":"Field","position":"OM4.14","length":0,"dataType":"CQ","dataTypeName":"Composite Quantity With Units","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Specimen Retention Time","description":null},{"id":"OM4.15","type":"Field","position":"OM4.15","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":"0376","tableName":"Special Handling Code","name":"Specimen Handling Code","description":null},{"id":"OM4.16","type":"Field","position":"OM4.16","length":0,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0920","tableName":"Preferred Specimen/Attribute Status","name":"Specimen Preference","description":null},{"id":"OM4.17","type":"Field","position":"OM4.17","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Preferred Specimen/Attribture Sequence ID","description":null},{"id":"OM4.18","type":"Field","position":"OM4.18","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Taxonomic Classification Code","description":null}]}
