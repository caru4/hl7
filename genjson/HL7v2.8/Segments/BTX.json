{"id":"BTX","segmentId":"BTX","longName":"Blood Product Transfusion/disposition","description":"The BP prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains to any type of blood product. A blood product is defined as any type of blood component or commercially prepared blood product that is prepared and dispensed from the transfusion service.\r\n\r\nThe BC prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains only to blood components. A blood component is defined as any part or all of a whole blood donation. For example, from one whole blood donation, the unit of whole blood can be fractionated into red blood cells, plasma and platelets with each component contained in separate bags. These types of blood products are always assigned a unique donation identification number as well as a product code that indicates the type of component contained in the bag.\r\n\r\nThe CP prefix in the element name indicates that the attribute pertains only to Commercial Products. A commercial product is defined as a commercially manufactured product, such as blood derivatives (Rh Immune Globulin, Factor VIII Concentrate or Blood Recipient Sets or Filters). These types of products are tracked by manufacturer and lot number and are not necessarily assigned a unique donation number.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_04"],"fields":[{"id":"BTX.1","type":"Field","position":"BTX.1","length":4,"dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Set Id - Btx","description":null},{"id":"BTX.2","type":"Field","position":"BTX.2","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Bc Donation Id","description":null},{"id":"BTX.3","type":"Field","position":"BTX.3","length":0,"dataType":"CNE","dataTypeName":"Coded With No Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Bc Component","description":null},{"id":"BTX.4","type":"Field","position":"BTX.4","length":0,"dataType":"CNE","dataTypeName":"Coded With No Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Bc Blood Group","description":null},{"id":"BTX.5","type":"Field","position":"BTX.5","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":"0512","tableName":"Commercial Product","name":"Cp Commercial Product","description":null},{"id":"BTX.6","type":"Field","position":"BTX.6","length":0,"dataType":"XON","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Name And Identification Number For Organizations","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Cp Manufacturer","description":null},{"id":"BTX.7","type":"Field","position":"BTX.7","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Cp Lot Number","description":null},{"id":"BTX.8","type":"Field","position":"BTX.8","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Bp Quantity","description":null},{"id":"BTX.9","type":"Field","position":"BTX.9","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Bp Amount","description":null},{"id":"BTX.10","type":"Field","position":"BTX.10","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"9999","tableName":"no table for CE","name":"Bp Units","description":null},{"id":"BTX.11","type":"Field","position":"BTX.11","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":"0513","tableName":"Blood Product Transfusion/Disposition Status","name":"Bp Transfusion/Disposition Status","description":null},{"id":"BTX.12","type":"Field","position":"BTX.12","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":"0511","tableName":"BP Observation Status Codes Interpretation","name":"Bp Message Status","description":null},{"id":"BTX.13","type":"Field","position":"BTX.13","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Bp Date/Time Of Status","description":null},{"id":"BTX.14","type":"Field","position":"BTX.14","length":0,"dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Bp Transfusion Administrator","description":null},{"id":"BTX.15","type":"Field","position":"BTX.15","length":0,"dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Bp Transfusion Verifier","description":null},{"id":"BTX.16","type":"Field","position":"BTX.16","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Bp Transfusion Start Date/Time Of Status","description":null},{"id":"BTX.17","type":"Field","position":"BTX.17","length":0,"dataType":"DTM","dataTypeName":"Date/time","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Bp Transfusion End Date/Time Of Status","description":null},{"id":"BTX.18","type":"Field","position":"BTX.18","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"*","tableId":"0514","tableName":"Transfusion Adverse Reaction","name":"Bp Adverse Reaction Type","description":null},{"id":"BTX.19","type":"Field","position":"BTX.19","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0515","tableName":"Transfusion Interrupted Reason","name":"Bp Transfusion Interrupted Reason","description":null},{"id":"BTX.20","type":"Field","position":"BTX.20","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"BP Unique ID","description":null}]}
