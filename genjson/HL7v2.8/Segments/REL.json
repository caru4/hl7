{"id":"REL","segmentId":"REL","longName":"Clinical Relationship Segment","description":"The Clinical Relationship segment contains the data necessary to relate two data elements within and/or external to the message at run-time. It also includes information about the relationship.\r\n\r\nRelationships are constrained to being between explicit segments of messages rather than beween the identities of entities they reference. Segments are available within the message but related persistent information may not be.  Because of the transient nature of messages applications must manage the associations with entities which persist outside or across messages.\r\nExamples: \r\n - Problem is a consequence of a diagnosis.\r\n - Diagnosis is supported by observation.\r\n - Observation is a manifestation of a diagnosis.\r\n - Complication is a consequence of a procedure.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_12"],"fields":[{"id":"REL.1","type":"Field","position":"REL.1","length":4,"dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","usage":"C","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Set Id -rel","description":null},{"id":"REL.2","type":"Field","position":"REL.2","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Relationship Type","description":null},{"id":"REL.3","type":"Field","position":"REL.3","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"This Relationship Instance Identifier","description":null},{"id":"REL.4","type":"Field","position":"REL.4","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Source Information Instance Identifier","description":null},{"id":"REL.5","type":"Field","position":"REL.5","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"R","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Target Information Instance Identifier","description":null},{"id":"REL.6","type":"Field","position":"REL.6","length":0,"dataType":"EI","dataTypeName":"Entity Identifier","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Asserting Entity Instance Id","description":null},{"id":"REL.7","type":"Field","position":"REL.7","length":0,"dataType":"XCN","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Id Number And Name For Persons","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Asserting Person","description":null},{"id":"REL.8","type":"Field","position":"REL.8","length":0,"dataType":"XON","dataTypeName":"Extended Composite Name And Identification Number For Organizations","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Asserting Organization","description":null},{"id":"REL.9","type":"Field","position":"REL.9","length":0,"dataType":"XAD","dataTypeName":"Extended Address","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Assertor Address","description":null},{"id":"REL.10","type":"Field","position":"REL.10","length":0,"dataType":"XTN","dataTypeName":"Extended Telecommunication Number","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Assertor Contact","description":null},{"id":"REL.11","type":"Field","position":"REL.11","length":0,"dataType":"DR","dataTypeName":"Date/time Range","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Assertion Date Range","description":null},{"id":"REL.12","type":"Field","position":"REL.12","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","name":"Negation Indicator","description":null},{"id":"REL.13","type":"Field","position":"REL.13","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Certainty Of Relationship","description":null},{"id":"REL.14","type":"Field","position":"REL.14","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Priority No","description":null},{"id":"REL.15","type":"Field","position":"REL.15","length":0,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Priority  Sequence No (rel Preference For Consideration)","description":null},{"id":"REL.16","type":"Field","position":"REL.16","length":1,"dataType":"ID","dataTypeName":"Coded Value For Hl7 Defined Tables","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":"0136","tableName":"Yes/no Indicator","name":"Separability Indicator","description":null}]}
