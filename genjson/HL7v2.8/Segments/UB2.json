{"id":"UB2","segmentId":"UB2","longName":"Uniform Billing Data","description":"The UB2 segment contains data necessary to complete UB92 bills specific to the United States. Realms outside the US are referred to chapter 16. Only Uniform Billing fields that do not exist in other HL7 defined segments appear in this segment. For example, Patient Name and Date of Birth are required; they are included in the PID segment and therefore do not appear here. Uniform Billing field locators are provided in parentheses ( ). The UB codes listed as examples are not an exhaustive or current list; refer to a UB specification for additional information.","sample":"","chapters":["CH_06"],"fields":[{"id":"UB2.1","type":"Field","position":"UB2.1","length":4,"dataType":"SI","dataTypeName":"Sequence Id","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Set Id - Ub2","description":null},{"id":"UB2.2","type":"Field","position":"UB2.2","length":3,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Co-insurance Days (9)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.3","type":"Field","position":"UB2.3","length":0,"dataType":"CWE","dataTypeName":"Coded With Exceptions","usage":"O","rpt":"7","tableId":"0043","tableName":"Condition Code","name":"Condition Code (24-30)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.4","type":"Field","position":"UB2.4","length":3,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Covered Days (7)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.5","type":"Field","position":"UB2.5","length":4,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Non-covered Days (8)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.6","type":"Field","position":"UB2.6","length":0,"dataType":"UVC","dataTypeName":"Ub Value Code And Amount","usage":"O","rpt":"12","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Value Amount & Code","description":null},{"id":"UB2.7","type":"Field","position":"UB2.7","length":0,"dataType":"OCD","dataTypeName":"Occurrence Code And Date","usage":"O","rpt":"8","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Occurrence Code & Date (32-35)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.8","type":"Field","position":"UB2.8","length":0,"dataType":"OSP","dataTypeName":"Occurrence Span Code And Date","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Occurrence Span Code/Dates (36)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.9","type":"Field","position":"UB2.9","length":29,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 2 (state)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.10","type":"Field","position":"UB2.10","length":12,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 11 (state)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.11","type":"Field","position":"UB2.11","length":5,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 31 (national)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.12","type":"Field","position":"UB2.12","length":23,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"3","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Document Control Number","description":null},{"id":"UB2.13","type":"Field","position":"UB2.13","length":4,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"23","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 49 (national)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.14","type":"Field","position":"UB2.14","length":14,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"5","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 56 (state)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.15","type":"Field","position":"UB2.15","length":27,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 57 (national)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.16","type":"Field","position":"UB2.16","length":2,"dataType":"ST","dataTypeName":"String Data","usage":"O","rpt":"2","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"UB92 Locator 78 (state)","description":null},{"id":"UB2.17","type":"Field","position":"UB2.17","length":3,"dataType":"NM","dataTypeName":"Numeric","usage":"O","rpt":"1","tableId":null,"tableName":null,"name":"Special Visit Count","description":null}]}
