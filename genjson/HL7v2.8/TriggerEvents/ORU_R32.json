However, in the POC environment, it is actually uncommon to have an order already generated when a test is performed. It does happen sometimes, though. If it is necessary to pass specific information related to the Patient, responsible Doctor, placing doctor, patient location, etc., there is a requirement for the inclusion of a PV1 and PD1 segment in the ORU message type (see also ORU^R30 for description).\r\n\r\nIf the receiving system accepts both the order and the result, it will return an ORA^R33 Application Acknowledgement message with the acknowledgement code of AA. A comment may be included in the Acknowledgement Message MSA Text Message field.\r\n\r\nIf the receiving system is unable to accept both the order and the result, no order or result should be placed and an ACK^33 Application Acknowledgement message must be returned to the sender with the error identified in the MSA Text Message field.\r\n\r\nThe sending system must return a commit-level acknowledgement in response to the ORA^R33 message.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_07"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restriction","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common Order","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBR","name":"OBR","longName":"Observation Request","sequence":"15","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"TIMING_QTY","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"TQ1","name":"TQ1","longName":"Timing/quantity","sequence":"18","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"TQ2","name":"TQ2","longName":"Timing/quantity Relationship","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"20","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
