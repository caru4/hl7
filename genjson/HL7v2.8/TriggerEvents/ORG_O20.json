{"id":"ORG_O20","msgStructId":"ORG_O20","eventDesc":"General clinical order response","description":"The function of this message is to respond to an OMG message. An ORG message is the application acknowledgment to an OMG message. See Chapter 2 for a description of the acknowledgment paradigm.\r\n\r\nIn ORG the PID and ORC segments are optional, particularly in case of an error response. However, ORC segments are always required in ORG when the OBR is present. For example, a response ORG might include only the MSH and MSA.\r\n\r\nThe function (e.g., cancel, new order) of both OMG and ORG messages is determined by the value in ORC-1-order control.
