{"id":"OUL_R22","msgStructId":"OUL_R22","eventDesc":"Unsolicited Specimen Oriented Observation Message","description":"This message was designed to accommodate specimen oriented testing. It should be applicable to container-less testing (e.g., elephant on a table) and laboratory automation systems requiring container.\r\n\r\nGenerally this construct allows transfer of multiple results related to a specimen from a patient, where this specimen has been in none, one, or multiple containers.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the patient results themselves it permits the communication of the following kinds of information:\r\n- Analysis results of a non patient related sample (e.g., environmental) – patient related segments (e.g., PID, PD1, PV1, PV2) are optional.\r\n- Analysis results to a particular container with QC sample and the lot and manufacturer information about this sample (SAC-INV segments) – however for this purpose the \"Unsolicited Specimen Container Oriented Observation Message\" (OUL^R23) is recommended due to explicit relation between the observation and the container.\r\n- Basic identification data (lot, manufacturer, etc.) of the reagents and other substances involved in the generation of analysis results (TCD-SID segments).\r\n\r\nRefer to Chapter 13 Laboratory Automation for additional examples of usage of SAC.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_07"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restriction","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit -
