{"id":"ORU_R40","msgStructId":"ORU_R40","eventDesc":"Unsolicited Alert Observation Message","description":"The R40 trigger event is used for observation reports that include an alertable condition, i.e., for which some timely human or application intervention in patient care may be indicated by the findings.  The ORA^R41 provides the application level response to the ORU^R40.\r\n\r\nThe ORU^R40 message is outside of the order-fulfilling cycle of the ORU and OUL messages with other trigger events, and is supplemental to those order-fulfilling observations.  As such, the results conveyed in the ORU^R40 do not replace, edit, or override the results of messages with other trigger events.   \r\n\r\nThe ORU^R40 message represents a unitary alert, which is to be acknowledged as a whole by an ORA message.  Multiple alerts requiring separate acknowledgement must be sent as individual messages.\r\n\r\nThe ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Group which has OBR-49 value A (Alert provider when abnormal) conveys the alert observation(s). One or more OBX segments in this Segment Group will typically have OBX-8 Interpretation Codes value of LL. HH, or AA.  At least one OBR segment shall have OBR-49 value A.  Other ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Groups within the message shall be considered supporting information for the alert observation(s).\r\n\r\nAn alert observation report may simply replicate observations conveyed in another observation message, e.g., sent in an ORU^R01 (the source observation). In such an instance the ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Group shall replicate the OBR (and ORC, if present) of the source observation.  \r\n\r\nAn alert observation reporting application may also derive a new alertable observation, e.g., from a combination of other observations from multiple orders, processed by a clinical decision support rule set. In this case, the ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Group with the alertable observation may use an OBR representing the \"order\" for clinical decision support, with this instance uniquely identified in the OBR-51 Observation Group ID.  Supporting source observations may be conveyed in subsequent ORDER_OBSERVATION Segment Groups in the message using their original OBR information.\r\n\r\nIf the reporting application can identify a preferred recipient for the alert, that may be conveyed in the PRT segment related to the OBR or OBX (with PRT-4 value RCT \"Results Copies To\"). This recipient may not be the same as the recipient(s) identified in a source observation.  There is no expectation that the reporting application will a priori know a preferred recipient, nor that the receiving application will deliver the alert to the identified recipient (e.g., it may be delivered to an \"on-call\" clinician in lieu of the identified recipient).","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_07"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_RESULT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NK1","name":"NK1","longName":"Next Of Kin / Associated Parties","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restriction","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit -
