{"id":"OMB_O27","msgStructId":"OMB_O27","eventDesc":"Blood product order","description":"Blood product order messages present the need for additional information that is not included in standard HL7 order messages. Order messages must contain accompanying details regarding the blood product component, such as special processing requirements (e.g., irradiation and leukoreduction), and the amount of the blood product to be administered. Additionally, specific relevant clinical information can be included to allow the prospective review of the appropriateness of the blood product order.\r\n\r\nBlood product orders use the OMB message with the BPO segment for the detail segment and the acknowledgment message, ORB as described below.\r\n\r\nThe NTE segment(s) can be included in the OMB message in four places; in each place the NTE refers to the segment that it follows. In particular, the NTEs following the MSH refer only to the message header; the NTEs following the blood product order segment apply to the service defined by that ORC and blood product order segment.\r\n\r\nThe PID segment is required if and only if new orders are being entered and they are related to a particular patient. For non-patient-related orders the PID segment is never included.\r\n\r\nThe optional PV1 segment is present mainly to permit transmission of patient visit information such as current location with an order.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_04"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restriction","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"INSURANCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IN1","name":"IN1","longName":"Insurance","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN2","name":"IN2","longName":"Insurance Additional Information","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"IN3","name":"IN3","longName":"Insurance Additional Information, Certification","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"GT1","name":"GT1","longName":"Guarantor","sequence":"15","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AL1","name":"AL1","longName":"Patient Allergy Information","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"ORDER","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common Order","sequence":"17","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"18","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"TIMING","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"TQ1","name":"TQ1","longName":"Timing/quantity","sequence":"19","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"TQ2","name":"TQ2","longName":"Timing/quantity Relationship","sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"BPO","name":"BPO","longName":"Blood Product Order","sequence":"21","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SPM","name":"SPM","longName":"Specimen","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"23","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"24","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"25","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"26","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"27","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"FT1","name":"FT1","longName":"Financial Transaction","sequence":"28","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"BLG","name":"BLG","longName":"Billing","sequence":"29","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
