{"id":"ORU_R31","msgStructId":"ORU_R31","eventDesc":"Unsolicited New Point-Of-Care Observation Message - Search For An Order","description":"This event trigger instructs the receiving system to search for an existing order for the observation(s) contained in the message.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the sending system does not know if an order has been placed. This transaction instructs the receiving system to search for an existing order for the associated results. If the receiver finds an existing order, it should return the Placer ID to the sender in the ORC segment of an OML^O21 message. This information allows the Observation Reviewer to correlate every result with its associated order.\r\n\r\nThe institution’s business rules will determine what the receiving system does if it can’t find a matching order. Possibilities include automatically placing an order (as in trigger event R30), or returning an application level error description in the Application Acknowledgement MSA Text Message field..\r\n\r\nIf it is necessary to pass specific information related to the Patient, responsible Doctor, placing doctor, patient location etc, there is a requirement for the inclusion of a PV1 and PD1 segment in the ORU message type (see also ORU^R30 for description).","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_07"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PD1","name":"PD1","longName":"Patient Additional Demographic","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARV","name":"ARV","longName":"Access Restriction","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT_OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"VISIT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"10","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","sequence":"11","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"12","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"ORC","name":"ORC","longName":"Common Order","sequence":"13","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"OBR","name":"OBR","longName":"Observation Request","sequence":"15","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"TIMING_QTY","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"TQ1","name":"TQ1","longName":"Timing/quantity","sequence":"18","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"TQ2","name":"TQ2","longName":"Timing/quantity Relationship","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"20","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"21","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}
