{"id":"EHC_E24","msgStructId":"EHC_E24","eventDesc":"Authorization Response","description":"This message is used to send results of an Authorization Request to a Provider Application. Authorization results are sent to the same Network Application ID that originated the Authorization Request, which was specified as the Sending Application on MSH on the original Authorization Request.\r\n\r\nIf the Payer Application is able to process the Authorization Request on-line, the EHC^E24 – Authorization Response message will contain the results of the authorization (e.g., approved, not approved).\r\n\r\nIf the Payer Application is not able to process the Authorization Request on-line, it creates an EHC^E24 – Authorization Response message once it has processed the Authorization Request (which may be the next day following receipt of the EHC^E20). Once prepared, the EHC^E24 is either sent to the Provider Application (if the Provider Application is able to receive unsolicited results) or stored on a queue for the Provider Application. If left on a queue for the Provider Application, then the QBP^E99 message must be used by the Provider Application to poll the Payer Application for the EHC^E24. If the Authorization is approved, then the Payer Application will return either an Authorization Number (Authorization Identifier on AUT) or individual who has authorized the Authorization Request (Name of Authorizer on AUT). The presence of the AUT segment in the EHC^E24 – Authorization Request Response message implies authorization has been granted. However, the Authorization may be restricted. Restrictions are specified under Payer Adjustments.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_16"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"SFT","name":"SFT","longName":"Software Segment","sequence":"2","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"UAC","name":"UAC","longName":"User Authentication Credential Segment","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"MSA","name":"MSA","longName":"Message Acknowledgment","sequence":"4","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ERR","name":"ERR","longName":"Error","sequence":"5","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"AUTHORIZATION_RESPONSE_INFO","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"IVC","name":"IVC","longName":"Invoice Segment","sequence":"6","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PSL_ITEM_INFO","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PSL","name":"PSL","longName":"Product/service Line Item","sequence":"7","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"AUT","name":"AUT","longName":"Authorization Information","sequence":"8","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ADJ","name":"ADJ","longName":"Adjustment","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}
