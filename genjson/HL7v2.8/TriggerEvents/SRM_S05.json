If none of the child appointments of a parent appointment have occurred, then a cancel trigger event should be sent instead.  If it is successful, an application acknowledgment is returned, optionally containing an SCH segment and related detail segments describing the discontinued appointment.","sample":null,"chapters":["CH_10"],"segments":[{"id":"MSH","name":"MSH","longName":"Message Header","sequence":"1","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"ARQ","name":"ARQ","longName":"Appointment Request","sequence":"2","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"3","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"4","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"PATIENT","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"PID","name":"PID","longName":"Patient Identification","sequence":"5","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV1","name":"PV1","longName":"Patient Visit","sequence":"6","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PV2","name":"PV2","longName":"Patient Visit - Additional Information","sequence":"7","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"OBSERVATION","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"OBX","name":"OBX","longName":"Observation/result","sequence":"8","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"PRT","name":"PRT","longName":"Participation Information","sequence":"9","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":"DG1","name":"DG1","longName":"Diagnosis","sequence":"10","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"RESOURCES","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"R","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"RGS","name":"RGS","longName":"Resource Group","sequence":"11","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":null,"name":"SERVICE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIS","name":"AIS","longName":"Appointment Information","sequence":"12","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"13","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"14","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"GENERAL_RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIG","name":"AIG","longName":"Appointment Information - General Resource","sequence":"15","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"16","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"17","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"LOCATION_RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIL","name":"AIL","longName":"Appointment Information - Location Resource","sequence":"18","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"19","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"20","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]},{"id":null,"name":"PERSONNEL_RESOURCE","longName":null,"sequence":null,"usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":true,"segments":[{"id":"AIP","name":"AIP","longName":"Appointment Information - Personnel Resource","sequence":"21","usage":"R","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"APR","name":"APR","longName":"Appointment Preferences","sequence":"22","usage":"O","rpt":"1","isGroup":false,"segments":null},{"id":"NTE","name":"NTE","longName":"Notes And Comments","sequence":"23","usage":"O","rpt":"*","isGroup":false,"segments":null}]}]}]}
